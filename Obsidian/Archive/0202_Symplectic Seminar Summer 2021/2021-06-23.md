Outline

Recommended approach: 3,4,9,10,11.

1.  ?
2.  Regularity
3.  Transversality (Recommended, but I skipped 3.4)
4.  Compactification and Bubbling
5.  More bubbling Only look at 5.1 and 5.2. Main results are 5.2.1, 5.3.1, skip the rest
6.  ?
7.  Defining ${\operatorname{GW}}_{\mathrm{A}_k}^M$? See 7.1, add marked points in 7.3. Count ration curves in ${\mathbb{P}}^n$ in 7.4. Needed to understand applications in chapter 9.

9.  Applications. Need background from 7.1.

Overview
========

-   Idea: count solutions to a non-linear elliptic PDE

Goal: define [[Gromov-Witten invariants](Gromov-Witten%20invariants) for genus 0 curves and some restricted classes of symplectic manifolds, particularly 4-manifolds - Bubbling - See Ch.4, Ch.5 - How is energy measured, and how do we deal with [bubbling](bubbling) - Needs a $\mathrm{Spin}^{{c} }$ structure? - [Donaldson invariant](Donaldson%20invariant): difficult to work with due to compactness issues. Easier in [Seiberg-Witten | ../../Unsorted/Seibergâ€“Witten%20invariants.html]] since the moduli space (up to gauge transformation) is compact

Applications
------------

Of SW:

-   Kronheimer/Mrowka: proved the [[Thom conjecture | ../../Unsorted/Thom%20conjecture.html]]: for ${\mathbb{CP}}^2$, a holomorphic curve is genus-minimizing among curves that represent homology classes

-   -   Morgan, Szabo, and Taubes to prove that a smooth symplectic curve of nonnegative self-intersection in a symplectic four-manifold is genus minimizing

-   Computable for Kahler manifolds, allowing enumeration of algebraic curves.

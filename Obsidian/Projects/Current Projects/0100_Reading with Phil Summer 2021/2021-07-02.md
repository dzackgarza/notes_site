## Notes

- $\bar\mgn$ denotes the DM compactification.

- Goal: look at moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces and equip it with a symplectic structure using the Weil-Petersson form.
  - Interesting because polfinalynomials involving volumes compute intersection numbers on $\mgn$.

- Curves with marked points = punctured Riemann surfaces = punctured surfaces with complete constant curvature Riemannian metrics.
  Almost all admit a hyperbolic metric.

- $\mgn(\vector L)$: moduli of hyperbolic surfaces with $n$ geodesic boundary components with lengths prescribed by $L_i$, up to boundary-label-preserving isometries.

- Construct as quotient of $\tgn$ to get an orbifold structure, use Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates to descend a Weil-Petersson symplectic form $\omega$, making $\mgn(\vector L)$ symplectic.

:::{.theorem title="Mirzakhani"}
Letting $\psi_i \in H^2(\bar\mgn; \QQ)$ be $\psi\dash$classes and $\kappa_1$ be the first Mumford-Morita-Miller class.
\[
V_{g, n}(\vector L) = \sum_{m + \sum a_i = 3g -3 + n}
{
\qty{2\pi^2}^m \prod L_i^{2a_i}
\over 
2^{\sum a_i } m! \prod a_i!
}
\int_{\bar\mgn} \kappa_1^m \prod \psi_i^{a_i}

- Gauss-Bonnet: for $K$ the Gaussian curvature,
\[
\int_\Sigma K \dV = 2\pi \chi(\Sigma)
.\]

  - For a metric of constant curvature $K=-1$ to exist, need $\chi(\Sigma) < 0$, so $2-2g-n<0$ where $(g, n)$ are the genus and number of punctures.

- Hyperbolic surfaces: $\HH^2 / G$ for $G\leq \PSL_2(\RR)$.

- Equivalence of categories between smooth algebraic curves and compact Riemann surfaces.

- Uniformization: Every Riemannian metric on $\Sigma$ is conformally equivalent to $g$, a complete constant curvature metric.
  $g$ is unique if $\chi(\Sigma)<0$ and the curvature $K=-1$.
  So Riemann surfaces biject with hyperbolic surfaces.
    - So every conformal class of metrics contains a hyperbolic metric when $\chi(\Sigma)<0$.
    - If $\Sigma$ is complete, the punctures become hyperbolic cusps.

- $\mgn(\vector 0)$ defined as hyperbolic surfaces with $n$ labeled cusps, homeomorphic as an orbifold to $\mgn$.
  - Interpret length zero geodesic boundaries as cusps.

- $\tgn(\vector L)$: moduli of marked hyperbolic surfaces $(S, f)$ where the marking is a diffeomorphism $f: \Sigma_{g, n}\to S$, up to isometries over $\Sigma$ that commute up to isotopy.

  - Example: hyperbolic Dehn twists cut along simple closed geodesics, twist, and glue back.
  Yields a loop in $\mgn(\vector L)$, since one full twist is a self-isometry, but lifts to a nontrivial path in $\tgn(\vector L)$

- Building blocks of surfaces with $\chi(\Sigma) < 0$: pairs of pants, i.e. $S^2$ with 3 punctures.
  - Pants decomposition: disjoint SCCs $\gamma$ where $\Sigma\sm \gamma = \disjoint P_i$ with $P_i$ a pair of pants.
  - Number of pants: exactly $-\chi(\Sigma) = 2g-2+n$ pants and $3g-3+n$ SCCs.
- Every SCC is homotopic to a unique simple closed geodesic.

- There is a fibering:

\begin{tikzcd}
	{\MCG_{g, n} \da \Diff^+(\Sgn) / \Diff_0^+(\Sgn)} && {\tgn(\vector L)} \\
	\\
	&& {\mgn(\vector L)}
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-3]
	\arrow[from=1-3, to=3-3]
\end{tikzcd}

  - The action is $[\phi] \actson (X, f) \da (X, f\circ \phi)$.
  This is properly discontinuous but not necessarily free, making $\dim \mgn(\vector L) = 6g-6+2n$.

- There is a homeomorphism $\tgn(\vector L) \to \RR_{\geq 0}^{m}\cross \RR^m$ for $m \da 3g-3+n$ where a surface is sent to its Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates (length and twist parameters).
  - Yields a symplectic form $\omega \da \sum_{k=1}^{\ell} d\ell_k \wedge d\tau_k$ with is remarkably $\MCG_{g, n}\dash$invariant.
  - By uniformization, as $g, n$ vary, the moduli spaces $\mgn$ are all diffeomorphic *but* not necessarily symplectomorphic.
- There is a finite cover $\tilde\mgn(\vector L)\to \mgn(\vector L)$ by a smooth manifold.
- Compactify by introducing *stable* curves everywhere: nodes on curves should correspond to degenerating the hyperbolic length of a SCC to zero.
  - Stable hyperbolic surface $\approx$ a collection of hyperbolic surfaces whose cusps have been formally paired up

- $\bar\mgn(\vector 0)$ admits a complex structure, but $\bar\mgn(\vector L)$ generally does not, although it admits a real-analytic structure.

- $[\omega] = 2\pi^2 \kappa_1$ in $H^2(\bar\mgn; \RR)$.

- $\mgn(\vector L)$ is homeomorphic as an orbifold to moduli of ribbon graphs

- Raise $\omega$ to enough powers to get
\[
\frac{\omega^{3 g-3+n}}{(3 g-3+n) !}=d \ell_{1} \wedge d \tau_{1} \wedge d \ell_{2} \wedge d \tau_{2} \wedge \cdots \wedge d \ell_{3 g-3+n} \wedge d \tau_{3 g-3+n}
.\]
  where $\tgn$ has infinite volume with respect to this form, but $\mgn$ has finite volume.

- Note $\mcm_{1, 1}(0)$ is exceptional since a generic point is an orbifold point with orbifold group $\ZZ/2$, since every hyperbolic torus with a cusp admits an elliptic involution.

:::{.example title="Volumes"}
Some volumes:
\[
V_{g, n}(\vector L) \da \int_{\mgn(\vector L)} {\omega^m \over m!} && m \da 3g-3+n
.\]


- $V_{0, 1}(x) = 0$
- $V_{0, 2}(x, y) = 0$
- $V_{0, 3}(x,y,z) = 1$
- $V_{0, 4}(0,0,0,0) = 2\pi^2$
- $V_{0, 4}(x,y,z,w) = {1\over 2}\qty{x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 + 4\pi^2 }$
- $V_{0, n}(\vector 0)$ admits a recursive formula in $n$.
- $V_{1, 1}(0) = \pi^2/12$
- $V_{1, 1}(x) = {1\over 48}\qty{x^2 + 4\pi^2}$.
- $V_{1, 2}(0, 0) = \pi^4/4$
- $V_{1, 2}(x, y) = {1\over 192} x^4 + {1\over 96} x^2 y^2 + {1\over 192} y^4 + {\pi^2 \over 12}x^2 + {\pi^2 \over 12} y^2 + {\pi^4 \over 4}$.
- $V_{g, n}(\vector 0) = q (2\pi^2)^{3g-3+n}$
- $V_{g, n}(\vector L) \in \RR\adjoin{L_i^2}$.

A striking observation: $V(g, 1)(2\pi i) = 0$ for all $g$.

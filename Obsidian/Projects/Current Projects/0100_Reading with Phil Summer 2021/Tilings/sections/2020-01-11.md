# Thursday, Week 1

## The Unicursal Problem

::: {.remark .proofenv title="on motivations"}
**Motivation:** Gauss' Unicursal Problem. How many distinct curves $\alpha: [0, 1] \to {\mathbb{R}}^2$ are there with no triple crossings?

Note that if we compactify the plane to the Riemann sphere (and possibly take the curve to be piecewise linear) then we obtain a *tiling* of the sphere. We can also take a *dual tiling* by taking the barycenters of each polygon and connecting them by an edge iff their corresponding polygons share an edge.
:::

::: {.definition .proofenv title="Translation surface"}
A **translation surface** is the 2-dimensional topological manifold obtained by taking any set of polygons in ${\mathbb{R}}^2$ and gluing their edges by translations. We take equivalence up to cutting, pasting, and rearranging.
:::

::: {.example .proofenv title="Elliptic curves"}
Any elliptic curve (topologically a torus) is a translation surface.
:::

::: {.lemma .proofenv title="?"}
Two elliptic curves (of genus 2) are isomorphic iff the translation surfaces differ by a homothety, i.e.Â a rotation and scaling.
:::

::: {.remark .proofenv}
We will eventually see that the data of a translation surface is equivalently a holomorphic 1-form.
:::

::: {.definition .proofenv title="Half-translation surface"}
A *half-translation surface* is a translation surface where we now additionally allow gluing by rotations of $\pi$ radians.
:::

::: {.example .proofenv title="?"}
An example:

`<p style="text-align:center;"> <img class="tikzpic" src="figures/b503ece4536a6479ced30ba6fa3f62d81722b405.svg"></p>`{=html}

Note that the gluing $b$ now requires a rotation. By gluing edges with matching letters, we get a "hot pocket" surface:

```{=tex}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
    none/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0},
    dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}
]
        \node [style=none] (0) at (-3, 3) {};
        \node [style=none] (1) at (3, 3) {};
        \node [style=none] (2) at (-3, -4) {};
        \node [style=none] (3) at (3, -4) {};
        \node [style=none] (4) at (-3, 2) {};
        \node [style=none] (5) at (3, 2) {};
        \node [style=none] (6) at (-3, -0.5) {};
        \node [style=none] (7) at (3, -0.5) {};
        \node [style=none] (8) at (-3, -2.75) {};
        \node [style=none] (9) at (3, -2.75) {};
        \draw (0.center) to (2.center);
        \draw (2.center) to (3.center);
        \draw (3.center) to (1.center);
        \draw (0.center) to (1.center);
        \draw [bend right] (4.center) to (5.center);
        \draw[dotted] [bend left=15] (4.center) to (5.center);
        \draw [bend right] (6.center) to (7.center);
        \draw[dotted] [bend left=15] (6.center) to (7.center);
        \draw [bend right] (8.center) to (9.center);
        \draw[dotted] [bend left=15] (8.center) to (9.center);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
```
:::

::: {.lemma .proofenv title="?"}
Any game of *rectangular billiards* yields a half-translation surface.
:::

::: {.proof .proofenv title="Sketch"}
Given any domain for rectangular billiards, we inflate it to a surface:

```{=tex}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
    none/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0},
    dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}
]
        \node [style=none] (0) at (-5, 6) {};
        \node [style=none] (2) at (0, 0) {};
        \node [style=none] (3) at (0, 4) {};
        \node [style=none] (4) at (3, 4) {};
        \node [style=none] (5) at (3, 2) {};
        \node [style=none] (6) at (6, 2) {};
        \node [style=none] (7) at (6, 6) {};
        \node [style=none] (8) at (-5, 0) {};
        \node [style=none] (9) at (-2.5, 6) {};
        \node [style=none] (10) at (-2.5, 0) {};
        \node [style=none] (11) at (1.5, 6) {};
        \node [style=none] (12) at (1.5, 4) {};
        \node [style=none] (13) at (4.5, 6) {};
        \node [style=none] (14) at (4.5, 2) {};
        \draw (0.center) to (8.center);
        \draw (8.center) to (2.center);
        \draw (2.center) to (3.center);
        \draw (3.center) to (4.center);
        \draw (4.center) to (5.center);
        \draw (5.center) to (6.center);
        \draw (6.center) to (7.center);
        \draw (0.center) to (7.center);
        \draw [bend right] (9.center) to (10.center);
        \draw[dotted] [bend left=15] (9.center) to (10.center);
        \draw [bend right=40] (11.center) to (12.center);
        \draw[dotted] [bend left=40, looseness=0.75] (11.center) to (12.center);
        \draw [bend right, looseness=0.75] (13.center) to (14.center);
        \draw[dotted] [bend left=15] (13.center) to (14.center);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
```
We can then cut along everything but the bottom edge to "unwrap" it into a half-translation surface:

```{=tex}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
    none/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0},
    dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}
]
        \node [style=none] (0) at (-5, 6) {};
        \node [style=none] (2) at (0, 0) {};
        \node [style=none] (3) at (0, 4) {};
        \node [style=none] (4) at (3, 4) {};
        \node [style=none] (5) at (3, 2) {};
        \node [style=none] (6) at (6, 2) {};
        \node [style=none] (7) at (6, 6) {};
        \node [style=none] (8) at (-5, 0) {};
        \node [style=none] (9) at (-2.5, 6) {};
        \node [style=none] (10) at (-2.5, 0) {};
        \node [style=none] (11) at (1.5, 6) {};
        \node [style=none] (12) at (1.5, 4) {};
        \node [style=none] (13) at (4.5, 6) {};
        \node [style=none] (14) at (4.5, 2) {};
        \node [style=none] (17) at (-5, -6) {};
        \node [style=none] (18) at (6, -6) {};
        \node [style=none] (22) at (0, -4) {};
        \node [style=none] (23) at (3, -4) {};
        \node [style=none] (24) at (6, -2) {};
        \node [style=none] (29) at (3, -2) {};
        \draw (0.center) to node [auto] {$a$} (8.center);
        \draw (8.center) to (2.center);
        \draw (2.center) to node [auto] {$b$}  (3.center);
        \draw (3.center) to (4.center);
        \draw (4.center) to (5.center);
        \draw (5.center) to (6.center);
        \draw (6.center) to (7.center);
        \draw (0.center) to (7.center);
        \draw (8.center) to node [auto] {$a$} (17.center);
        \draw (17.center) to (18.center);
        \draw (2.center) to  node [auto] {$b$} (22.center);
        \draw (22.center) to (23.center);
        \draw (23.center) to (29.center);
        \draw (29.center) to (24.center);
        \draw (24.center) to (18.center);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

## Questions related to rectangular billiards

::: {.question .proofenv title="1"}
Given a random starting point and direction, what proportion of the total region is traversed? Will the trajectory entire a given region? How long does the billiard spend in any given region?
:::

::: {.answer .proofenv}
This requires some ergodic theory.

::: {.theorem .proofenv title="?"}
The percentage of time spent in a given region is equal to the proportion of its area to the total area.
:::
:::

::: {.question .proofenv title="2"}
If you shine a laser from a given spot, is the entire region illuminated?
:::

::: {.answer .proofenv}
No! There is a counterexample with 18 sides. Moreover, no positive-area region can be avoided, but certain finite sets can.
:::

::: {.definition .proofenv title="Flat surface"}
A **flat surface** is a generalization of translation surfaces that now allows gluing by any isometry of ${\mathbb{R}}^2$.
:::

::: {.example .proofenv title="?"}
A cube in ${\mathbb{R}}^3$ is a flat surface, noting that the planar gluing diagram for it now requires rotations of $\pi/2$ radians:

![Image](figures/2020-01-11-22:16.png)\

Note that we can form higher genus surfaces using polygon gluing:

```{=tex}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
    none/.style={fill=black,shape=circle,scale=0.5},
    dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}
]
        \node[style=none] (0) at (-0.75, 2.5) {};
        \node [style=none] (1) at (0.75, 2.5) {};
        \node [style=none] (2) at (-1.75, 1.25) {};
        \node [style=none] (3) at (1.75, 1.25) {};
        \node [style=none] (4) at (-1.75, -0.25) {};
        \node [style=none] (5) at (1.75, -0.25) {};
        \node [style=none] (6) at (-0.75, -1.5) {};
        \node [style=none] (7) at (0.75, -1.5) {};
        \node [style=none] (8) at (-1.75, 1.25) {};
        \draw (0.center) to node [auto] {$d$}  (8.center);
        \draw (8.center) to node [auto] {$a$}  (4.center);
        \draw (4.center) to node [auto] {$b$}  (6.center);
        \draw (6.center) to node [auto] {$c$}  (7.center);
        \draw (7.center) to node [auto] {$d$}  (5.center);
        \draw (5.center) to node [auto] {$a$}  (3.center);
        \draw (3.center) to node [auto] {$b$}  (1.center);
        \draw (1.center) to node [auto] {$c$}  (0.center);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
```
:::

::: {.exercise .proofenv title="?"}
Check that there is only one vertex in this polygon.
:::

::: {.definition .proofenv title="Cone points and cone angles"}
In general, the vertices may have total angle greater than $2\pi n$. We refer to these as **cone points**, and the total angle as the **cone angle**.
:::

::: {.exercise .proofenv title="?"}
Check that the cone angle in the above example is $6\pi$ by taking a loop around the cone point.
:::

::: {.remark .proofenv}
There is a weird phenomenon: it seems difficult to find ${\mathbb{Z}}^2$ or ${\mathbb{Q}}^2$ points on the sloped edges of a regular polygon, based on computer drawings.
:::

::: {.remark .proofenv}
This flat surface admits charts to ${\mathbb{C}}$ with the following transition functions. Let $P$ denote the single cone point.

Then there is a 3-fold cover give by the following space, thought of as a singular helical

```{=tex}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
    none/.style={fill=black,shape=circle,scale=0.5},
    dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}
]
    \draw (0, 0) circle (3cm);
    \node [style=none, label=P] (0) at (0, 0) {};
    \node [style=none] (1) at (3, 0) {};
    \draw (0.center) to node [above] {$C$} node [below] {$A$} (1.center);

    \draw (0, -7) circle (3cm);
    \node [style=none, label=P] (0) at (0, -7) {};
    \node [style=none] (1) at (3, -7) {};
    \draw (0.center) to node [above] {$A$} node [below] {$B$} (1.center);

    \draw (0, -14) circle (3cm);
    \node [style=none, label=P] (0) at (0, -14) {};
    \node [style=none] (1) at (3, -14) {};
    \draw (0.center) to node [above] {$B$} node [below] {$C$} (1.center);

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
```
which maps onto the unit disc in ${\mathbb{C}}$:

```{=tex}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
    none/.style={fill=black,shape=circle,scale=0.5},
    dashed/.style={text opacity=0,opacity=0,fill opacity=0}
]
    \draw (0, 0) circle (3cm);

    \node [style=none, label=P] (P) at (0, 0) {};
    \node [style=none] (u1) at  ({1*360/3}: 3cm){};
    \node [style=none] (u2) at  ({2*360/3}: 3cm){};
    \node [style=none] (u3) at  ({3*360/3}: 3cm){};

    \draw (P) to (u1);
    \draw (P) to (u2);
    \draw (P) to (u3);

    \node [label=1] (u1) at  ({1*360/6}: 1.5cm){};  
    \node [label=2] (u1) at  ({3*360/6}: 1.5cm){};
    \node [label=3] (u1) at  ({5*360/6}: 1.5cm){};

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
```
The covering map from the former to the latter is given by $z\mapsto z^{\frac 1 3}$, which coincides with the fact that the cone angle at $P$ is $3(2\pi) = 6\pi$.

One can also imagine this space in ${\mathbb{R}}^3$ with a projection onto the plane: `\pgfplotsset{compat=1.16,width=10cm,height=14cm}`{=tex}
```{=tex}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[trig format plots=rad,
        view={-40}{6*pi},
        colormap={adopted}{
            rgb255(0cm)=(219,0,70);
        rgb255(1cm)=(55,70,170);
            rgb255(2cm)=(219,0,70)
        },
        z buffer=sort,
        zmin=0]
\addplot3 [surf,domain=0.001:4,domain y=-pi/2:6*pi-pi/2,samples=25,samples y=40]
({x*cos(y)},{x*sin(y)},{ln(x)+y});
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
```
Here the helicoid goes through three full twists, where the top and bottom pieces are identified.
:::

::: {.proposition .proofenv title="?"}
In a neighborhood of a cone point $P$ with cone angle $2\pi n$, the map $z\mapsto z^{\frac 1 n}$ will be a local chart for any $z$ in a neighborhood of $P$.

This gives the resulting surface the structure of a **Riemann surface**, i.e.Â a surface admitting charts to ${\mathbb{C}}$ with holomorphic transition functions.
:::

::: {.remark .proofenv}
Let $X$ be a Riemann surface, we can look at the *canonical bundle* over $X$ with sections that are compatible collections of $f_u(z_u) ~dz_u$ for each chart $z_u$, and for each such chart a holomorphic function $f_u(z_u)$ on $z_u(U)$ where on overlaps

`\begin{align*}
f_u(z_u) ~dz_u &= f_v(z_v) ~dz_v \\
&= f_v(z_v \circ z_u) z_v'(z_u) ~dz_u
.\end{align*}`{=tex}
:::

::: {.definition .proofenv title="Translation surface (updated)"}
A **translation surface** is a Riemann surface with a section of its canonical bundle.
:::

::: {.example .proofenv title="?"}
$C/\Lambda$ for $\Lambda$ any rank-2 lattice:

![Image](figures/2020-01-11-23:35.png)

Note that the translation here is given by $\mathbf{\lambda}$.
:::

::: {.definition .proofenv title="Holomorphic 1-forms"}
A **holomorphic 1-form** is a section of the canonical bundle.
:::

::: {.example .proofenv title="?"}
For the above surface, we have $z_v = z_u + \mathbf{\lambda}$ and thus $dz_u = dz_v$ is nonvanishing. Note that $dz$ is a holomorphic 1-form on the complement of the vertex/vertices of the polygon.
:::

::: {.proposition .proofenv title="?"}
$dz$ extends holomorphically to charts containing cone points with cone angle $2\pi n$ and has a zero of order $n-1$ at such cone points.
:::

::: {.example .proofenv title="?"}
For the chart $z=w^3$ where $w$ is the local coordinate, we have $dz = 3w^2$, yielding a zero of order 2.

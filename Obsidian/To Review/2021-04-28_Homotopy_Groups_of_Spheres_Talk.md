# Summary

## Big Points

-   Homotopy as a means of classification somewhere between homeomorphism and cobordism
-   Comparison to homology
-   Higher homotopy groups of spheres exist
-   Homotopy groups of spheres govern gluing of CW complexes
-   CW complexes fully capture that homotopy category of spaces
-   There are concrete topological constructions of many important algebraic operations at the level of spaces (quotients, tensor products)
-   Relation to framed cobordism?
-   "Measuring stick" for current tools, similar to special values of L-functions
-   Serre's computation

## History

-   1860s-1890s: (Roughly) defined by Jordan for complex integration, "combinatorial topology"
    -   Original motivation: when does a path integral depend on a specific path? (E.g. a contour integral in ${\mathbb{C}}$)
-   1895: Poincare, *Analysis situs* ("the analysis of position") in analogy to Euler *Geometria situs* in 1865 on the Kongisberg bridge problem Attempts to study spaces arising from gluing polygons, polyhedra, etc (surfaces!), first use of "algebraic invariant theory" for spaces by introducing $\pi_1$ and homology.
-   1920s: Rigorous proof of classification of surfaces (Klein, MÃ¶bius, Clifford, Dehn, Heegard), captured entirely by $\pi_1$ (equivalently, by genus and orientability).
-   1925-1928: Noether, Mayer, Vietoris develop general algebraic theory of homology, now "algebraic topology"
-   1931: Hopf discovers a nontrivial (not homotopic to identity) map $S^3 \to S^2$
    -   Compare to homology: $H^k S^n = 0$ for $k\geq n$ is an easy theorem!
-   1932/1935: Cech (resp Hurewicz) introduce higher homotopy groups, gives a map relating homotopy to homology, shows they are abelian groups for $n\geq 2$.
    -   Withdrew his paper because of this theorem!
-   1937: Freudenthal suspension theorem, investigation into "stable" phenomena.
-   1938: Pontrayagin shows link between homotopy groups of spheres and framed cobordism classes of submanifolds of $S^n$.
    -   Direction of computation: using cobordism classes (geometric) to compute $\pi_k S^n$. Modern day: run the computation backwards to compute cobordism groups.
-   1940: Eilenberg, obstruction theory
-   1949: Whitehead introduces homotopy types, CW complexes, equivalences = weak equivalences. Importance of homotopy classes of maps between spheres becomes apparent
-   1951: Serre uses spectral sequences to show that *all* groups $\pi_k S^n$ are torsion except $k=n$, and $k\equiv 3\operatorname{mod}4, n\equiv 0 \operatorname{mod}2$.
    -   In first case, ${\mathbb{Z}}$, in second case, ${\mathbb{Z}}\oplus T$ for some torsion group.
    -   Tight bounds on where $p{\hbox{-}}$torsion can occur.
-   1953: Whitehead shows the homotopy groups of spheres split into stable and unstable ranges.
-   Today: We know $\pi_{n+k}S^n$ for
    -   $k \leq 64$ when $n\geq k+2$ (stable range)
    -   $k \leq 19$ when $n < k+2$ (unstable range)
    -   We *only* have a complete list for $S^0$ and $S^1$, and know *no* patterns beyond this!

## Actual Outline

Visualization: the same way $S^2\setminus{\operatorname{pt}}\to {\mathbb{R}}^2$ via stereographic projection, we take $S^3\setminus{\operatorname{pt}}\to {\mathbb{R}}^3$. Realizes $S^3$ as a family of circles parameterized by a 2-sphere, fiber above each point is a circle.

## Theorems and Definitions

A map $f: X \to Y$ is called a *weak homotopy equivalence* if the induced maps $f^*_i: \pi_i(X, x_0) \to \pi_i(Y, f(x_0))$ are isomorphisms for every $i \geq 0$. If a map $X \xrightarrow{f} Y$ satisfies $f(X^{(n)}) \subseteq Y^{(n)}$, then $f$ is said to be a *cellular map*. Any map $X \xrightarrow{f} Y$ between CW complexes is homotopic to a cellular map. For every topological space $X$, there exists a CW complex $Y$ and a weak homotopy equivalence $f: X \to Y$. Moreover, if $X$ is $n{\hbox{-}}$dimensional, $Y$ may be chosen to be $n{\hbox{-}}$connected and is obtained from $X$ by attaching cells of dimension greater than $n$. **Abbreviated statement**: if $X, Y$ are CW complexes, then any map $f: X \to Y$ is a weak homotopy equivalence if and only if it is a homotopy equivalence. (Note: $f$ must induce maps on all homotopy groups simultaneously.) If $X$ is an $n{\hbox{-}}$ connected CW complex, then there are maps $\pi_i X \to \pi_{i+1} \Sigma X$ which is an isomorphism for $i\leq 2n$ and a surjection for $i=2n+1$.

    -   *Proof*: Covering space theory

-   Theorem: $\pi_{1+k} S^1 = 0$ for all $0 < k < \infty$

    -   *Proof*: Use universal cover by ${\mathbb{R}}$
    -   Theorem: Covering spaces induce $\pi_i X \cong \pi_i \tilde X, i \geq 2$

    -   $S^n$ is simply connected.

    -   Alternatively:
        -   LES of Hopf fibration gives $\pi_1 S^1 \cong \pi_2 S^2$
        -   Freudenthal suspension: $\pi_k S^k \cong \pi_{k+1} S^{k+1}, k \geq 2$

        -   $\tilde f$ maps the $k{\hbox{-}}$skeleton to a point,

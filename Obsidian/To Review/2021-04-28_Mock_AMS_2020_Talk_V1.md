# Intro/Motivation

## Space, but Which One?

-   You run into a "space" in the wild. Which one is it?

-   How many possible spaces *could* it be?

-   How much information is needed to specify our space uniquely?

## Possible Applications: Physics

## Possible Applications: Data

Possible to fit data to a high-dimensional manifold, makes clustering/grouping easier (here, slice with a hyperplane).

Can extract information about an entire family of objects and how they vary. Also useful for outlier detection!

## Where to Start

-   Where to start the hunt: what structure does it have? What can you "measure", what does it look like locally? How might it vary in ways you can't measure?

-   Important question before attempting to classify:

    1.  **What does "space" mean**? Need to pick a category to work in.

    2.  **What does "which space" mean**? Need an equivalence relation.

# Question 2: Which Space?

## The Greeks: Conics

-   Early classification efforts: **conic sections**.

    -   Apollonius, 190 BC, Ancient Greeks

-   Key idea: realize as intersection loci in bigger space (projectivize ${\mathbb{R}}^2$)

-   Note the 6 coefficient parameters

-   Each conic is a variety, and we can obtain *every* conic by \"modulating\* the 6 parameters.

## The Greeks: Conics

-   We can imagine a *moduli space of conics* that parameterizes these:

-   All of ${\mathbb{R}}^6$ is too much information: scaling by a nonzero $\lambda \in {\mathbb{R}}$ yields the same conic, so we can reduce the space `
    <span class="math display">
    \begin{align*}  
    {\left[ {A, B, C, D, E, F} \right]}\in {\mathbb{R}}^6 \mapsto  {\left[ {A: B: C: D: E: F} \right]} \in {\mathbb{RP}}^5
    .\end{align*}
    <span>`{=html}

-   Important point: ${\mathbb{RP}}^5$ is a projective variety and a smooth manifold! Tools available:

    -   Dimension (what does a generic point look like?)
    -   Tangent and cotangent spaces, differential forms
    -   Measures, metrics, volumes, integrals
    -   Intersection theory (Bezout's Theorem!), subvarieties, curves
    -   Linear algebra and Combinatorics (enumerative questions)

## Quadrics

`
<span class="math display">
\begin{align*}  
\begin{array}{l}
A x^{2}+B y^{2}+C z^{2}+2 F y z+2 G z x+2 H x y+2 P x+2 Q y+2 R z +D=0 \\ \\
\text{Setting} \quad 
E\coloneqq\left[\begin{array}{llll}
A & H & Q & P \\
H & B & F & Q \\
G & F & C & R \\
P & Q & R & D
\end{array}\right] \qquad 
e\coloneqq\left[\begin{array}{lll}
A & H & G \\
H & B & F \\
G & F & C
\end{array}\right] \qquad 
\Delta \coloneqq\operatorname{det}(E)
\end{array}
\end{align*}
<span>`{=html}

(discriminants), the equation becomes $\mathbf{x}^t E \mathbf{x} = 0$ and we have a classification:

> What is the moduli space? It sits inside ${\mathbb{R}}^{16}$, possibly ${\mathbb{RP}}^{15}$ but not in the literature.

## Automorphisms

-   Problem: infinitely many points in these moduli spaces correspond to the same "class" of conic

-   How to address: Klein's Erlangen program, understand the geometry of a space by understanding its structure-preserving automorphisms.

    -   For affine space ${\mathbb{A}}^n_{\mathbb{K}}$: $\mathrm{Aff}({\mathbb{A}}^n_{\mathbb{K}}) = {\mathbb{A}}^n_{\mathbb{K}}\rtimes_\psi \operatorname{GL}({\mathbb{A}}^n_{\mathbb{K}})$, i.e. "twist" a translation with an non-singular linear transformation.
    -   For Euclidean space, want isomoetries. ${\mathbb{R}}^n$: can "reduce structure groups" to get ${\mathbb{R}}^n \rtimes_\psi O(n, {\mathbb{R}})$, i.e. a rotation and a translation.
        -   Can restrict to orientation preserving: ${\mathbb{R}}^n \rtimes_\psi SO(n, {\mathbb{R}})$.
    -   For topological spaces: a Lie group.

-   Can then "mod out" by the appropriate morphisms to (hopefully) get finitely many equivalence classes

# What Does "Space" Mean?

## Some Setup

-   **Algebraic Variety**: Irreducible ,zero locus of some family $f\in {\mathbb{k}}[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$ in ${\mathbb{A}}^n/{\mathbb{k}}$.
    -   Equivalently, a locally ringed space $(X, {\mathcal{O}}_X)$ where ${\mathcal{O}}_X$ is a sheaf of finite rational maps to ${\mathbb{k}}$.
-   **Projective Variety**: Irreducible zero locus of some family $f_n \subset {\mathbb{k}}[x_0, \cdots, x_n]$ in ${\mathbb{P}}^n/{\mathbb{k}}$
    -   Admits an embedding into ${\mathbb{P}}^n/{\mathbb{k}}$ as a closed subvariety.
-   **Dimension** of a variety: the $n$ appearing above.
-   **Topological Manifold**: Hausdorff, 2nd Countable, topological space, locally homeomorphic to ${\mathbb{R}}^n$.
    -   Equivalently, a locally ringed space where ${\mathcal{O}}_X$ is a sheaf of continuous maps to ${\mathbb{R}}^n$.
-   **Smooth Manifold**: Topological manifold with a smooth structure (maximal smooth atlas) with $C^\infty$ transition functions.
    -   Equivalently, a locally ringed space where ${\mathcal{O}}_X$ is a sheaf of smooth maps to ${\mathbb{R}}^n$.
-   **Algebraic Manifold**: A manifold that is also a variety, i.e. cut out by polynomial equations. Example: $S^n$.

## Impossible Goal

-   Notation: most dimensions will be over ${\mathbb{R}}$, manifolds will be compact and without boundary, varieties are (probably) smooth, separated, of finite type.

-   **Impossible Goal**: pick a category, understand *all* of the objects (identifying a moduli "space") and *all* of the maps.

    -   Understand all topological spaces up to ???
        -   Homeomorphism?
        -   Diffeomorphism?
        -   Homotopy-Equivalence?
        -   Cobordism?
    -   Understand all algebraic and/or projective varieties up to
        -   Biregular maps?
        -   Birational maps?
        -   Locally ringed morphisms?

# Classification in Topology

-   Two main categories with a forgetful functor: $\mathbf{Diff} \to \mathbf{Top}$.

    -   What's in the "image" of this functor?
        -   Manifolds that admit a differentiable structure.
    -   What is the "fiber" above a given topological manifold?
        -   Distinct differentiable structures.

-   Classifying manifolds: considered open in a few directions, current work in classifying morphisms (mapping class groups, Torelli groups), knot theory, embeddings/immersions/submersions/isometries

-   General slogan: classified by geometric data in low dimensions ($\leq 4$), algebraic data in high dimensions

## Topological Category

Classifying manifolds up to homeomorphism: stratify "moduli space" of topological manifolds by dimension.

-   Dimensions 0,1,2,3:
    -   Smooth = Top. See smooth classification.
-   Dimension 4:
    -   *Topologically* classified by surgery, but barely, and not smoothly.
-   Dimension $n\geq 5$:
    -   Uniformly "classified" by surgery, s-cobordism, with a caveat:
    -   $\pi_1$ can be any finitely presented group -- word problem
    -   Instead, breaks homotopy type of a fixed manifold up into homeomorphism classes

# Classification in Algebraic Geometry

## [[../Unsorted/Enriques-Kodaira Classification | ../Unsorted/Enriques-Kodaira%20Classification.html]]

## Interesting Space: Elliptic Curves

-   Equivalently, Riemann surfaces with one marked point.
-   Equivalently, ${\mathbb{C}}/\Lambda$ a lattice, where homothetic lattices (multiplication by $\lambda \in {\mathbb{C}}\setminus\left\{{0}\right\}$) are equivalent.
-   Generalize to ${\mathbb{C}}^n/\Lambda$ to obtain *abelian varieties*.

## Interesting Space: Moduli of Elliptic Curves

-   ${\mathcal{M}}_g$: the moduli space of compact Riemann surfaces (curves) of genus $g$, i.e. elliptic curves.

-   Parameterized by a moduli space:

    -   For $X = {\mathbb{C}}/\Lambda$ choose a positively oriented basis $\Lambda = z{\mathbb{Z}}\oplus w{\mathbb{Z}}$.
        -   Note: push into meridians on a torus, generators of $H_1(X)$, and require that their intersection is $+1$.
    -   Replace ${\left[ {z, w} \right]}$ with ${\left[ {1, \tau} \right]}$ where $\tau = {w\over z}$; the orientation condition forces $\Im(\tau) > 0$ so this yields a point $\tau \in {\mathbb{H}}$.
    -   Account for automorphisms: roughly ${\operatorname{SL}}(2, {\mathbb{Z}})$.

## Dimension 2: Algebraic Surfaces

-   Definition: **Kodaira Dimension**

    -   Given a projective variety $X$ of dimension complex dimension 2..
    -   Use the canonical bundle to *try* to get a rational map $f: \Sigma \to {\mathbb{CP}}^\infty$ So define $\kappa(\Sigma) = \dim_{\mathbb{C}}(f(\Sigma))$
        -   *(really, take a maximum dimension over a linear system)*
    -   If this doesn't work, set dimension to $-\infty$.

-   Fact: `
    <span class="math display">
    \begin{align*}
    \kappa(X) \in \left\{{-\infty, 0, 1, \cdots, \dim_{\mathbb{C}}(X)}\right\}
    .\end{align*}
    <span>`{=html}

-   Alternative definition:

    -   $X$ has some canonical sheaf $\omega_X$, you can take some sheaf cohomology and get a sequence of integers (*plurigenera*) `
        <span class="math display">
        \begin{align*}  
        P_{\mathbf{n}} (X) &\coloneqq h^0(X, \omega_X^{\otimes\mathbf{n}}) \quad n\in {\mathbb{Z}}^{\geq 0} \\ \\
        \implies \kappa(X) &\coloneqq\limsup_{\mathbf n \to \infty} {\log P_{\mathbf n}(X) \over \log(\mathbf{n})  }
        .\end{align*}
        <span>`{=html}

## Dimension 2: Algebraic Surfaces

Every such surface has a minimal model of one of 10 types:

$\kappa = -\infty$ (2 main types)

1.  Rational: $\cong {\mathbb{CP}}^2$
2.  Ruled: $\cong X$ for ${\mathbb{CP}}^1 \to X \to C$ a bundle over a curve. Called "ruled" because every point is on some ${\mathbb{CP}}^1$.
3.  Type VII (non-algebraic)

$\kappa = 0$ (Elliptic-ish, 4 types)

4.  Enriques (all (quasi)-elliptic fibrations)
5.  Hyperelliptic

-   Taking Albanese embedding (generalizes Jacobian for curves) yields an elliptic fibration
    -   *(i.e. a surface bundle, potentially with singular fibers)*

6.  $K3$ (Kummer-Kahler-Kodaira) surfaces
7.  Toric and Abelian Surfaces:

-   2 dimensional abelian varieties (projective algebraic variety + algebraic group structure).
-   Compare to 1 dimensional case: all 1d complex torii are algebraic varieties,
    -   Riemann discovered that most 2d torii are *not*.

8.  Kodaira Surfaces

$\kappa = 1$: Other elliptic surfaces

9.  Properly quasi-elliptic. Elliptic fibration, but almost all fibers have a node.

$\kappa = 2$ (Max possible, "everything else") 10. General type

# Interesting Space: Toric Varieties

-   Flavor: spaces modeled on convex polyhedra
-   Examples: bundles over ${\mathbb{CP}}^n$.
-   Why study:
-   Model spaces by rigid geometry, generalize things like Bezier curves
-   Some are determined by rigid combinatorial data ("fan", or polytopes)
-   Combinatorial data for constructions in mirror symmetry, e.g. Calabi-Yaus (1/2 of one billion threefolds!)
-   Definition:
    -   Define a *complex torus* as $(C^{\times})^n \subseteq {\mathbb{C}}^n$

    -   Can be written as the zero set of some $f\in {\mathbb{C}}[x_0, \cdots, x_n]$ in ${\mathbb{C}}^{n+1}$.

        > Generalizes to algebraic groups over a field: $({\mathbb{G}}_m)^n$ (analogy: maximal torus/Cartan subalgebra in Lie theory)

    -   **Toric variety**: $X$ contains a dense Zariski-open torus ${\mathbb{T}}$, where the action of ${\mathbb{T}}$ on itself as a group extends to $X$.

## Interesting Space: Kahler Manifolds/Varieties

-   As complex manifolds:
    -   A symplectic manifold $(X, \omega)$ with an integrable almost-complex structure $J$ compatible with $\omega$.
    -   Yields an inner product on tangent vectors: $g(u, v) \coloneqq\omega(u, Jv)$ (i.e. a metric)
-   Includes smooth projective varieties, but not all complex manifolds (exception: Stein manifolds)
-   Specialize to Calabi-Yaus: compact, Ricci-flat, trivial canonical
    -   Calabi's Conjecture and Yau's field medal: existence of Ricci-flat Kahlers (Calabi-Yaus)

> Trivial canonical class = vanishing chern class = exists a nowhere vanishing top form = top wedge of $T {}^{ \vee }X$ is the trivial line bundle

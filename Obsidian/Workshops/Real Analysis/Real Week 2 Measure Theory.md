## Convergence Tips/Tricks

-   Our favorite tools: **metrics** and **norms**!
    -   ![[_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210528184220.png]]
    -   So show things are equal by showing ${\left\lvert {x-y} \right\rvert} = 0$. Know the triangle inequality by heart!
-   **Uniform convergence**:
    -   ![[_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210528182641.png]]
    -   Negating: find a bad ${\varepsilon}$ and a single bad point $x$.
    -   Showing a sum converges uniformly: remember that $\sum_{k\geq 1} a_k$ is *defined* to be $\lim_{N\to\infty} \sum_{k\leq N} a_k$. So the trick is to define $f_n(x) := \sum_{k\leq n} a_k$ and then apply the usual criteria above.
    -   It's sometimes useful to trade the $\forall x$ in the definition with $\sup_{x\in X} {\left\lvert {f_n(x) - f(x)} \right\rvert} < {\varepsilon}$ instead.
-   Compare and contrast to **pointwise convergence**, which is strictly weaker:
    -   ![[_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210528182925.png]]
    -   The main difference: pointwise can depend on the $x$ and the ${\varepsilon}$, but uniform needs one ${\varepsilon}$ that works for *all* $x$ simultaneously.
    -   Note uniform implies pointwise but not conversely.
-   The sup norm: ${\left\lVert {f} \right\rVert}_\infty := \sup_{x\in X} {\left\lvert {f_n(x)} \right\rvert}$
    -   A useful way to force uniform convergence: bound your sequence uniformly by a sequence that goes to zero:
    -   ![[_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210528183356.png]]
-   **Sups and infs**: sup is the least upper bound, inf is the greatest lower bound.
-   The $p-$test: `
    <span class="math display">
    \begin{align*}
    \sum_{n\geq 1} {1 \over n^p} < \infty \iff p>1
    \end{align*}
    <span>`{=html}
-   Useful fact: convergent sums have **small tails**, i.e.Â  `
    <span class="math display">
    \begin{align*}
    \sum_{n\geq 1} a_n < \infty \implies \lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{n\geq N} a_n = 0
    \end{align*}
    <span>`{=html}
-   So try bounding things from above by the *tail* of a sum!
-   If you can't bound by a tail: as long as you have control over the coefficients, you can pick them to make the sum to converge "fast enough".
    -   Example: for a fixed ${\varepsilon}$, choose $a_n = 1/2^n$. Note that $\sum_{n\geq 1} 1/2^n = 1$, so choose $a_n := {\varepsilon}/2^n$: `
        <span class="math display">
        \begin{align*}
        \cdots \leq \sum_{n\geq 1} a_n := \sum_{n\geq 1} {{\varepsilon}\over 2^n} = {\varepsilon}\to 0
        \end{align*}
        <span>`{=html}
-   The ${\varepsilon}/3$ trick:

-   **The $M{\hbox{-}}$test**:

## Measure Theory

-   $F_\sigma$ sets: unions of closed sets ($F$ for *fermi*, French for closed. Sigma for sums, ie unions)
-   $G_\delta$ sets: intersections of open sets
-   $\sigma$ algebras: closed under complements, countable intersections, countable unions
-   Some of the most useful properties of measures:

![[_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210528184432.png) ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210528184444.png) ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210528184451.png]]

-   The proof of continuity of measure contains a very useful trick: replace a sequence of sets $\left\{{E_k}\right\}$ with a sequence of *disjoint* sets that either union or intersect to the same thing.
    -   Example: if $A_1 \subseteq A_2 \subseteq \cdots$, set $F_1=A_1$ and $F_k = A_k \setminus A_{k-1}$ for $k\geq 2$. Then $\displaystyle\bigcup_{k\geq 1} A_k = \displaystyle\coprod_{k\geq 1} F_k$.
-   Occasionally you need some properties of **outer measures**:

![[_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210528184814.png) ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210528184827.png]]

-   Outer measure for ${\mathbb{R}}^n$: you consider all collections of cubes that cover your set, sum up their volumes, and take the infimum over all such collections:

![[_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210528184951.png]]

-   "Almost everywhere *blah*" : the set where *blah* does not happen has measure zero.
-   "Infinitely many/all but finitely many" types of sets, which show up in Borel-Cantelli style problems

-   Lemmas that sometimes show up on quals:

## Fubini-Tonelli

Quick statement:

![[_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210528185415.png]]

Explained in Stein and Shakarchi (Fubini, which requires **integrability**)

![[_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210528185725.png) ![](_attachments/Pasted%20image%2020210528185759.png]]

And Tonelli, which only requires **measurability**:

Week 1: Preliminaries
=====================

Topics
------

-   Complex arithmetic and geometry, conic section equations
-   Uniform (continuity, differentiability, convergence)
-   Inverse and implicit function theorems
-   Green's theorem, Stokes theorem
-   Complex plane, Riemann sphere

Warmup
------

-   State the Cauchy-Riemann equations.

-   Define what it means for a function to be

    -   Holomorphic
    -   Meromorphic
    -   Analytic
    -   Harmonic
    -   Uniformly continuous
    -   Uniformly bounded
    -   Entire

-   What does it mean for a sequence or series to uniformly converge?

-   State the Laplace equation.

-   What is the Dirichlet problem?

-   Discuss how to carry out partial fraction decomposition

-   Determine the radius of convergence of the power series for $\sqrt z$ expanded at $z_0= 4 + 3i$.

-   What is the logarithmic derivative?

-   Find a function $f$ such that $f^2$ is analytic on the open unit disc but $f$ is not.

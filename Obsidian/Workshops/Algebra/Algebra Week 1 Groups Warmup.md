## Unsorted Questions

For everything that follows, assume $G$ is a finite group.

-   $H\leq G$ denotes that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$.
-   $\# G$ denotes the *order* of $G$.
-   $e$ or $e_G$ denotes the identity element of $G$.
-   Multiplicative notation is generally used everywhere to denote the (possibly noncommutative) binary operation
-   $G/H$ is the set of left cosets of $G$ by $H$.

### Cosets

-   Let $H\leq G$ be a subgroup (not necessarily normal). Prove that any two cosets $xH, yH\in G/H$ have the same cardinality.

    > Define a map $m_g: G\to G$ where $x\mapsto gx$, restrict to $m_h:H\twoheadrightarrow gH$, inverse $(m_g)^{-1}= m_{g^{-1}}$

-   Prove the *fundamental theorem of cosets*: for $xH, yH\in G/H$, `
    <span class="math display">
    \begin{align*}
    xH = yH \iff x^{-1}y\in H \iff y^{-1}x \in H
    \end{align*}
    <span>`{=html}

> Use that $xH = yH\iff x\sim y$ is an equivalence relation (reflexive/symmetric/transitive) - Suppose $\# G = pq$ with $p, q\geq 2$ prime, and let $H\leq G$ be a proper subgroup. Prove that $H$ must be cyclic.

> Use (and prove) the classification of groups of order $p$.

\#\#\# Orders

-   Prove Lagrange's theorem.

> Use $G = {\textstyle\coprod}_{i=1}^n g_i H$, that cosets all have cardinality $\# H$, and $\# {\textstyle\coprod}X_i = \sum \# X_i$

-   Prove Cauchy's theorem.

> Induce on $\# G$. Assume $\# G > p$ and pick $g\neq 1$. If $p\divides \# g$, use cyclic group theory, so assume otherwise. Use that $\#G = \#G/N \#N$ so $p$ divides $\# G/N$, apply IH to get an element of order $p$ in the quotient. Then $y\not\in N$ but $y^p\in N$, so $\left\langle{y}\right\rangle\neq \left\langle{y^p}\right\rangle$ since $y^p\in N \implies \left\langle{y^p}\right\rangle \subseteq N$. Get $p\divides \# \left\langle{y}\right\rangle$, apply IH. - Prove that if $\# G$ is prime, then $G$ is cyclic

    > Assume there are two distinct generators and reach a contradiction.

-   Prove that for every $g\in G$, the order of $g$ divides the order of $G$.
-   Prove that if $\# G = n$, then $g^n = e$ for every $g\in G$

### Normal Subgroups

-   Let $s\in G$, and state the definition of the **centralizer** of $C_G(s)$ of $s$ in $G$.

    -   Show that $C(s) \leq G$ is a subgroup.
    -   Let $\left\langle{ s }\right\rangle \subseteq C_G(s)$, where $\left\langle{ s }\right\rangle$ is the subgroup of $G$ generated by $s$.
    -   Prove that $\left\langle{ s }\right\rangle{~\trianglelefteq~}G$ is in fact a **normal** subgroup.

-   Let $H\leq G$ be a subgroup and $N{~\trianglelefteq~}G$ be a normal subgroup. Show that $NH \leq G$ is a subgroup.

-   Let $G_1, G_2$ be groups and $H_2 \leq G_2$ a subgroup. Suppose $\phi: G_1\to G_2$ is a group morphism.

    -   Show that the image $\phi(G_1) \leq G_2$ is a subgroup of $G_2$
    -   Show that the preimage $\phi^{-1}(H_2) \leq G_1$ is a subgroup of $G_1$,
    -   Show that the kernel $\ker \phi {~\trianglelefteq~}G_1$ is a normal subgroup of $G_1$.
    -   Prove that group morphisms *preserve coset structure* in the following sense: `
        <span class="math display">
        \begin{align*}
        xH_1 = yH_1 \iff \phi(x)H_2 = \phi(y)H_2
        .\end{align*}
        <span>`{=html}
    -   Prove the **first isomorphism theorem**: $\phi$ is injective $\iff \ker \phi = \left\{{ e_{G_1} }\right\}$.

### Symmetric Groups

-   Let $\sigma = (4\, 2\, 1)(6\, 1\, 3\, 2) \in S_6$ in cycle notation.
    -   Write $\sigma$ as a product of disjoint cycles.
    -   Compute the order of $\sigma$. What is the general theorem about the order of cycles?
    -   Determine if $\sigma$ is even or odd. What is the general theorem?
-   Suppose $\phi: S_n \to G$ with $n$ even and $\# G = m$ odd.
    -   Prove that if $\tau \in S_n$ is a transposition, then $\tau \in \ker \phi$.
    -   Prove that in fact *every* $\sigma \in S_n$ satisfies $\sigma \in \ker \phi$, so $\phi$ is the trivial morphism.
    -   Does this hold if $n$ is odd?

### Matrix Groups

-   Let ${\mathbb{F}}_p$ be the finite field with $p$ elements, where $p$ is a prime. Show that the centers of $\operatorname{GL}_n({\mathbb{F}}_p)$ and ${\operatorname{SL}}_n({\mathbb{F}}_p)$ consist only of scalar matrices.
    -   Show that the scalars $\zeta$ that appear in scalar matrices $Z({\operatorname{SL}}_n({\mathbb{F}}_p))$ are roots of unity in ${\mathbb{F}}_p$, i.e.Â $\zeta^p = 1$.
-   Determine the orders $\# \operatorname{GL}_n({\mathbb{F}}_p)$ and $\# {\operatorname{SL}}_n({\mathbb{F}}_p)$.

## Warmup Problems

-   (**Important**) Prove that if $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic then $G$ is abelian.

    > Write $Z = Z(G)$, fix $x,y\in G$. Since $G/Z = \left\langle{gZ}\right\rangle$, $xZ = (gZ)^m = g^mZ$ and $yz = (gZ)^n = g^nz$ $g^{-m}x, g^{-n}y \in Z \implies x = g^m z_1, y = g^n z_2$ $xy = g^m z_1 g^n z_2$, everything commutes.

-   (**Important**) Classify all groups of order $p^2$.

    > Must be abelian since quotient is cyclic. If there's an element of order $p^2$, cyclic, done. Else every element $a\neq 1$ must have order $p$. Then $\left\langle{a}\right\rangle\neq G$, so pick $b$ in its complement, it has order $p$. Call these two subgroups $H, K$ Recognize direct products: abelian implies both are normal, $H \cap K = \left\{{1}\right\}$. and $\#HK = \# H \# K / \#(H \cap K) = p\cdot p/1 = p^2$

-   (**Important**) Show that if $H\leq G$ and $[G: H] = 2$ then $H$ is normal.

    > Index 2 implies partition into 2 left cosets: $H, gH$, or two right cosets $H, Hg'$ Note that $gH = G\setminus H = Hg'$ Pick $x$, want to show that $xHx^{-1}= H$, so $xH = Hx$. Case 1: $x\in H\implies xH = H = Hx$ Case 2: $xH\neq H \implies xH = gH$. Similarly $Hx \neq H \implies Hx = Hg'$, so `
    > <span class="math display">
    > \begin{align*}xH = gH = G\setminus H = Hg' = Hx\end{align*}
    > <span>`{=html}

    -   Suppose that the same result holds with 2 replaced by $p$ defined as the smallest prime factor of $\# G$

-   Prove that if $H\leq G$ is a proper subgroup, then $G$ can not be written as a union of conjugates of $H$.

    -   Use this to prove that if $G = \operatorname{Sym}(X)$ is the group of permutations on a finite set $X$ with $\# X = n$, then there exists a $g\in G$ with no fixed points in $X$.

-   Let $G\leq H$ where $H$ is a finite $p{\hbox{-}}$group, and suppose $\phi: G\to H / [H, H]$ be defined by composing the inclusion $G\hookrightarrow H$ with the natural quotient map $H \to H/[H, H]$.

    Prove that $G= H$ by induction on $\# H$ in the following way:

    -   Letting $N{~\trianglelefteq~}H$ be any nontrivial normal subgroup of $H$, use the inductive hypothesis to show that $H = GN$.
    -   Let $Z = Z(H)$ be the center of $H$. Using that $GZ = H$ by (1), show that $G \cap Z \neq \emptyset$. Set $N \coloneqq G \cap Z$ and apply (1) to conclude.

-   Determine all pairs $n, p\in {\mathbb{Z}}^{\geq 1}$ such that ${\operatorname{SL}}_n({\mathbb{F}}_p)$ is solvable.

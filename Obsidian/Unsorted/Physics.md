- Irreducible reps of $\SO_3$ describe the periodic table
- Irreducible reps of $\SU_2$ lead to Dirac equations of the electron
- Standard Model: $\SU_3 \cross \SU_2 \cross \U_1$

$\SO(n)$ and its relativistic analog $\SO(1,n)$ define symmetries of space time. $\SU(n)$ defines fundamental quantum mechanical phase space symmetries. $\Sp(n)$ defines symmetries in cases where there is a quaternionic structure.

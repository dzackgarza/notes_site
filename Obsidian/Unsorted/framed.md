# Definitions

:::{.definition title="parallelizable"}
If the tangent bundle of a manifold is trivial, the manifold is said to be **parallelizable**.
:::

- Parallelizable/framed: a trivialization of the [tangent%20bundle.md](tangent%20bundle.md).
- Equivalently, the [section%20of%20a%20bundle.md](section%20of%20a%20bundle.md).


## Results

- Fact: the only parallelizable spheres are 
$$
S^0, S^1, S^3, S^7
$$ 
corresponding to $\RR, \CC, \mathbb{H}, \mathbb{O}$.

:::{.proposition title="?"}
$S^1$ is parallelizable.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
Let $M = S^1$, then the tangent bundle yields a rank 1 vector bundle
$$
\RR \to TM \to M
$$
We can find a nonzero global section: the vector field 
$$
s(x, y) := -y\dx + x\dy \quad\in \Gamma( T\RR^2 )
$$ 
restricted to $S^1$:

> Todo: 

:::{.proposition title="?"}
$S^2$ is not parallelizable.
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
Let $M = S^2$, which is associated to the rank 2 vector bundle
$$\RR^2 \to TM \to M$$

Then $TM$ is trivial iff there are 2 independent global sections. Since there is a zero section, a second independent section must be everywhere-nonzero - however, this would be a nowhere vanishing vector field on $S^2$, which by the Hairy Ball theorem does not exist.
:::

:::{.proof title="Alternative"}
Any such a vector field would allow a homotopy between the identity and the [antipodal%20map](antipodal%20map) on $S^2$, a contradiction.

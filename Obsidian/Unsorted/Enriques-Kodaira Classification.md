-   Minimal model program: classifying complex projective varieties.

-   Stratify the "moduli space" of varieties by ${\mathbb{k}}{\hbox{-}}$dimension.

-   Dimension 1:

    -   Smooth Algebraic curves = compact Riemann surfaces, classifed by genus
    -   Roughly known by Riemann: moduli space of smooth projective curves ${\mathcal{M}}_g$ is a connected open subset of a projective variety of dimension $3g-3$.

-   Dimension 2:

    -   Smooth Algebraic Surfaces: Hard. See Enriques classification.

    -   Setting of classical theorem: always 27 lines on a cubic surface!

    -   Example Clebsch surface, satisfies the system `

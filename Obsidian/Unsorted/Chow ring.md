Paper on Chow Rings
===================

Cohomology for [Symmetric%20algebra](Symmetric%20algebra) on the group of characters.

There is a map from the Chow ring back into cohomology, which in general fails surjectivity and injectivity. Tensoring this map with ${\mathbb{Q}}$ creates an isomorphism, though. In this case, both have the ring structure of invariants under the [maximal%20torus). (Classical result, Leray and Borel.](maximal%20torus).%20(Classical%20result,%20Leray%20and%20Borel.)

Chow rings have not been computed for $\operatorname{PGL}_n$. Need to know about [[Euler%20class.md | Euler%20class.html]],

$A_*$ known for all $O_n$ and $SO_n$ for $n$ odd in 80s, general result for $SO_n$ 2004. $PGL_n$ case is much harder. Understood for $n=2$, since $\operatorname{PGL}_2 \cong SO_3$. Other bits that have been computed: $H^*({\mathbf{B}}\operatorname{PGL}_3, {\mathbb{Z}}/3), H^*({\mathbf{B}}\operatorname{PGL}_n, {\mathbb{Z}}_2)$ for $n = 2 \operatorname{mod}4$ in 70s/80s, incomplete results for $H^*({\mathbf{B}}\operatorname{PGL}_p, {\mathbb{Z}}_p)$ in 2003.

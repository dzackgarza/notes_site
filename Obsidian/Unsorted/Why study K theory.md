Why study $K$-theory? {#why-study-k-theory}
=====================

Examples of results gleaned from the \[\[Adams operations\]\].

It played a major role in the second proof of the Index Theorem (circa 1962). In 1955, Jean-Pierre Serre had used the analogy of vector bundles with \[\[Serre's conjecture on vector bundles\]\],

Geometrically

-   Finitely generated projective modules $\rightleftharpoons$ \[\[vector bundles\]\] over ${\mathbb{A}}^N$,
-   free modules $\rightleftharpoons$ trivial vector bundles.

Affine space is topologically contractible, so It admits no non-trivial topological vector bundles. It also admits no non-trivial holomorphic vector bundles. Jean-Pierre Serre remarked that the corresponding question was not known for \[\[algebraic vector bundles\]\]: \> \"It is not known whether there exist projective $A{\hbox{-}}$modules of \[\[finite type\]\], where $A = k[x_1, ..., x_n]$ is a polynomial ring over a field.

# Why study $K$-theory? {#why-study-k-theory}

Examples of results gleaned from the [Adams%20operations](Adams%20operations).

It played a major role in the second proof of the Index Theorem (circa 1962). In 1955, Jean-Pierre Serre had used the analogy of vector bundles with [[Serre's%20conjecture%20on%20vector%20bundles.md | Serre's%20conjecture%20on%20vector%20bundles.html]],

Geometrically

-   Finitely generated projective modules $\rightleftharpoons$ [[vector%20bundles.md | vector%20bundles.html]] over ${\mathbb{A}}^N$,
-   free modules $\rightleftharpoons$ trivial vector bundles.

Affine space is topologically contractible, so It admits no non-trivial topological vector bundles. It also admits no non-trivial holomorphic vector bundles. Jean-Pierre Serre remarked that the corresponding question was not known for [[algebraic%20vector%20bundles](algebraic%20vector%20bundles): \> \"It is not known whether there exist projective $A{\hbox{-}}$modules of [finite%20type.md | finite%20type.html]]

where $A = k[x_1, ..., x_n]$ is a polynomial ring over a field.

# Why study $K$-theory?
Examples of results gleaned from the [[Adams operations]].

It played a major role in the second proof of the Index Theorem (circa 1962).
In 1955, Jean-Pierre Serre had used the analogy of vector bundles with [[Serre's conjecture on vector bundles]],

Geometrically

- Finitely generated projective modules $\mapstofrom$ [[vector bundles]] over $\AA^N$, 
- free modules $\mapstofrom$ trivial vector bundles. 
 
Affine space is topologically contractible, so It admits no non-trivial topological vector bundles. It also admits no non-trivial holomorphic vector bundles. Jean-Pierre Serre remarked that the corresponding question was not known for [[algebraic vector bundles]]: 
> "It is not known whether there exist projective $A\dash$modules of [[finite type]], where $A = k[x_1, ..., x_n]$ is a polynomial ring over a field.

**Definition (Hamiltonian)**: A smooth function $H: M \to {\mathbb{R}}$ will be referred to as an energy functional or a *Hamiltonian*. If we have $H: M\times I \to {\mathbb{R}}$, we'll refer to this as a *time-dependent Hamiltonian*, i.e.Â the time slices $H_t: M \to {\mathbb{R}}$ given by $H_t(p) = H(p, t)$ are Hamiltonians. \^1c3cf2

**Definition (Hamiltonian vector field):** Given a smooth functional $H: (M, \omega) \to {\mathbb{R}}$, the associated *Hamiltonian vector field* is the unique field $X_H$ satisfying $\omega(X_H, {-}) = dH$.

Remark: Conservation of energy Since $\omega$ is alternating, `

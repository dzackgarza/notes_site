Given a finite CW-complex, $X$, I can embed it into a large sphere $S^n$ in a nice way so that the complement deformation retracts onto a finite CW-complex, $Y$. This is called the **Spanier-Whitehead dual** of $X$.

The thing is, $Y$ is not determined up to homotopy by $X$. However, the stable homotopy type of $Y$ is determined by $X$, independent of the choice of embedding or sphere. This basically follows from [Alexander duality](Alexander%20duality). So if we want to make arguments exploiting duality, it's best to work in the stable category.

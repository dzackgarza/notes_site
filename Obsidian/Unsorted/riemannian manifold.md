Here is a very fundamental way to create interesting Riemannian manifolds: Let $G$ be a [../Unsorted/symmetric%20space.md](../Unsorted/symmetric%20space.md) attached to $G$.

The Riemannian structure comes from an invariant metric on $G$, and so $G$ acts as isometries on $G/K$ by left translation.

If you now take a discrete subgroup $\Gamma$ of $G$, you can form the double quotient $\Gammaâˆ–G/K$. These are some of the most celebrated [moduli%20stack%20of%20abelian%20varieties.md](moduli%20stack%20of%20abelian%20varieties.md).

P.S. I should also note that the study of spaces $\dcoset{\Gamma}{G}{K}$ for certain $\Gamma$ (so-called [Lie%20group.md](Lie%20group.md).

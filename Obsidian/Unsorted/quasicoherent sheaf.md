- A Noetherian [scheme.md) $X$ can be reconstructed from $\QCoh(X](scheme.md)%20$X$%20can%20be%20reconstructed%20from%20$/QCoh(X)$, see Gabriel 1962.
	- Idea: associate to an [ringed%20space.md](ringed%20space.md) $\spec \cat{A}$ and show 
	$$X \underset{\Ringedspace}{\mapsvia{\cong}} \spec \cat{\QCoh(A)}$$
- A smooth variety $X$ can *not* generally be reconstructed from its [ample%20bundle.md](ample%20bundle.md).
- In 2002 Balmer reconstructs a [Noetherian%20scheme](Noetherian%20scheme)
from its [perfect%20complexes.md](perfect%20complexes.md).

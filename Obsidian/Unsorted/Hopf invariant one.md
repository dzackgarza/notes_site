# Motivation

Hopf famously discovered an essential (i.e. non-nullhomotopic) map $S^3\to S^2$, which you can think of as the being defined via $S^3\to \CP^1$ and then choosing an identification of $\CP^1$ with the sphere. The [mapping cone](mapping%20cone.md) of this map is a CW-complex and asking whether or not the map $S^3\to S^2$ is non-nullhomotopic is equivalent to asking whether or not this mapping cone is homotopy equivalent to a wedge $S^4\vee S^2$. We can see that it is not since the mapping cone is actually just $\CP^2$ and the cup square of the generator in $H^2$ is the generator in $H^4$. More generally, given a map $S^{2nâˆ’1}\to S^n$ we can form the 2-cell complex given by gluing $\DD^{2n}$ along this map and ask if the cup square of the generator in degree $H^n$ squares to the generator in degree $2n$. If it does we say this map has [Hopf invariant one](Hopf%20invariant%20one.md), otherwise it has Hopf invariant 0. It's natural to ask **how many maps of Hopf invariant one can we build**? The answer is: not many. They only exist when $n=1,2,4,8$. While nowadays we usually learn the proof of this fact using [K-Theory](K-Theory.md), which is very short.

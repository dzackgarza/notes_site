#bundles 

Formed by by collapsing the complement of the normal bundle?

Thought of as a twisted suspension, since for a trivial bundle $B\cross \RR^n  \mapsvia{p} B$ we have $\Th(p) = \Suspend^n B_+$.

Can also construct $\Th(p)$ by applying a fiberwise one-point compactification on $E$ and identifying all the added points to a single basepoint.

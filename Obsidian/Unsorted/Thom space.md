\#bundles

Formed by by collapsing the complement of the normal bundle?

Thought of as a twisted suspension, since for a trivial bundle $B\times{\mathbb{R}}^n \xrightarrow{p} B$ we have $\mathop{\mathrm{Th}}(p) = {\Sigma}^n B_+$.

Can also construct $\mathop{\mathrm{Th}}(p)$ by applying a fiberwise one-point compactification on $E$ and identifying all the added points to a single basepoint.

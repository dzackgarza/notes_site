\*Open Problem:\*\* Does every triangular billiards admit a [[periodic%20orbit.md | periodic%20orbit.html]]?

*Answer (1775):* Yes for acute triangles, there is at least one periodic orbit:

For arbitrary triangles: unknown!

Let $M$ be a [[Hamiltonian.md | Hamiltonian.html]].

For [regular%20value) $r\in {\mathbb{R}}$ of the Hamiltonian, \$H`^{-1}`{=tex}(r](regular%20value)%20$r/in%20/RR$%20of%20the%20%20Hamiltonian,%20$H/inv(r) \subset M$ is a submanifold $Y\subset M$ with a smooth vector field $X_H$ called a *regular level set*.

**Question:** Does $X_H$ have a closed orbit on every regular level set? What conditions do you need to guarantee the existence of a closed orbit?

Turns out not to depend on $H$, and only on the hypersurface $Y$. The existence of a closed orbit is equivalent to the existence of a closed embedded curve $\gamma$ that is everywhere tangent to $\ker( {\left.{{\omega}} \right|_{{Y}} } )$.

**Question:** When is such a curve guaranteed to exist?

**Theorem (Weinstein, 1972):** If $Y$ is convex.

**Theorem (Rabinowitz)**: If $Y$ is "star-shaped" (exists a point $p$ that can "see" all points via straight lines).

**Theorem (1987):** Every contact-type hypersurface in the [[periodic%20orbit.md | periodic%20orbit.html]].

**Conjecture (Weinstein, 1978):** Let $(M, \xi)$ be a closed (compact) [[periodic%20orbit.md | periodic%20orbit.html]].

**Theorem (Weinstein, Dimension 3, Overtwisted. 1993):** Let $(M, \lambda, \xi)$ be a closed [[overtwisted%20contact%20structure.md](overtwisted%20contact%20structure.md). Then the [periodic%20orbit.md | periodic%20orbit.html]].

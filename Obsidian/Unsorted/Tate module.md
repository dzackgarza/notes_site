# Motivation

- Studying [[moduli stack of abelian varieties]] $E$.
- The most important object is the **$\ell\dash$adic  [[Tate module]] of $E$**, $T_\ell(E)$.
- It is able to detect the ability to lift $E/k$ to the [[ring of integers]] $O_k$.
- Also captures the [[isogeny]] class of $E$ over a finite field, and the number of points over all finite fields.
- Fails spectacularly when $E/\FF_{p^s}$ is a [[supersingular]] elliptic curve, in which case taking $\ell = p$ yields $T_p E = 0$.
- Leads to considering the [[group scheme]] $E[\ell^n]$, which is [[etale]] when $\ell \neq p$, but $E[p^n]$ is never Ã©tale.
- Leads to replacing $T_p E$ with the directed system $\theset{E[p^n]}_n$.

Define the l-adic Tate module:
$$
T_\ell E := \inverselim_{n} E[\ell^n]
$$
and the adelic Tate module
$$
T_\infty E ;= \inverselim_{n} E[n]
$$

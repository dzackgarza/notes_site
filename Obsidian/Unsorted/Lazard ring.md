> Lazard proved that it has a very simple structure: it is just a polynomial ring (over the integers) on generators of degree 1, 2, 3, ... (where $c_{i,j}$ has degree $(i + j âˆ’ 1)$). Quillen (1969) proved that the coefficient ring of [complex cobordism](complex%20cobordism) is naturally isomorphic as a graded ring to Lazard's universal ring.

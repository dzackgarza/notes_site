Definition: A 3-manifold of the form $M \cong S^3/\Gamma$ where $\pi_1(M) \cong \Gamma \leq {\operatorname{SO}}_4({\mathbb{R}})$.

-   If $\Gamma$ is finite cyclic, $M$ is a 3-dimensional [lens%20space](lens%20space)

-   [[3-manifold.md | Three-manifold.html]] with finite fundamental group are spherical.

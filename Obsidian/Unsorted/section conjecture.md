Tags: \#conjectures

I think the whole field of [[Subjects/homotopy%20theory.md | ../Subjects/homotopy%20theory.html]] theory.

As an example of a specific instance of the anabelian philosophy, we have Grothendieck's celebrated **section conjecture**, which states (in one form) that for a 'nice' curve X over a [rational%20points](rational%20points) are in bijection with the sections of the exact sequence `
<span class="math display">
\begin{align*}
1 \rightarrow \pi_1(X_{\mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5muF\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu}) \rightarrow \pi_1(X) \rightarrow G_F \rightarrow 1
\end{align*}
<span>`{=html} where $G_F$ is the [profinite%20completion](profinite%20completion) of the regular fundamental group.

The conjecture is still a wide open problem, but any proof would mean you could check something of number theoretic interest (existence of [[curves.md) | curves.html]]) by studying maps between certain generalized homotopy groups!

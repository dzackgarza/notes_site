 I think the whole field of [Subjects/homotopy%20theory.md](../Subjects/homotopy%20theory.md) theory.

 As an example of a specific instance of the anabelian philosophy, we have Grothendieck's celebrated **section conjecture**, which states (in one form) that for a 'nice' curve X over a [rational%20points](rational%20points) are in bijection with the sections of the exact sequence
$$
1 \rightarrow \pi_1(X_{\bar{F}}) \rightarrow \pi_1(X) \rightarrow G_F \rightarrow 1
$$
where $G_F$ is the [profinite%20completion](profinite%20completion) of the regular fundamental group.

The conjecture is still a wide open problem, but any proof would mean you could check something of number theoretic interest (existence of [curves.md)](curves.md)) by studying maps between certain generalized homotopy groups!

Dirichlet’s theorem states that for each integer $m > 1$ and each integer $a$ coprime to $m$, there are infinitely many primes $p \equiv a \mod m$

More is true: [Chebotarev%20density](Chebotarev%20density) tells us that for each modulus $m$ the primes are equidistributed among the residue classes of the integers $a$ coprime to $m$.

Dirichlet's theorem states that if N≥2 is an integer and a is coprime to N, then the proportion of the primes p congruent to a mod N is asymptotic to 1/n, where n=φ(N) is the Euler totient function. This is a special case of the Chebotarev density theorem for the Nth cyclotomic field K

t implies that as a Galois extension of K, L is uniquely determined by the set of primes of K that split completely in it.[6] A related corollary is that if almost all prime ideals of K split completely in L, then in fact L = K.[7]

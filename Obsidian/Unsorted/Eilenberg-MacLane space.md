# Questions

- Why do Eilenberg-MacLane spaces have complicated higher cohomology?
  - Dually, why do spheres have higher complicated homotopy?

- $\B G \homotopic K(G, 1)$ and $\B^n G \homotopic K(G, n)$ when $n\geq 2$ for $G$ an abelian discrete group.
	- What is $\B^n$?
	- What is $\pi_* \B G$ for $G$ nonabelian and nondiscrete?
	#unanswered_questions 
	
# Results
- $\Loop^n \B^n G \homotopic G$.

## Uniqueness of E-M Spaces
If $X$ is a space with one nontrivial homology group $G$ in degree $k$, so that $X$ satisfies
$$\pi_i(X) = \cases{G,~i=k\\0,~\text{otherwise}}$$
Then $X \simeq K(G, k)$.

*Note: two spaces with isomorphic homotopy groups may *not* be homotopy-equivalent in general - this is one exception.*

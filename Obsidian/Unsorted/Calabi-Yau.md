- Definition: ?

- Another from [Kähler%20Manifold](Kähler%20Manifold)

- Setting for [Mirror%20Symmetry.md](Mirror%20Symmetry.md): the symplectic geometry of a Calabi-Yau is "the same" as the complex geometry of its mirror.

- Applications: Physicists want to study $G_2$ manifolds (an exceptional Lie group, automorphisms of octonions), part of $M\dash$theory uniting several [Superstring%20theory.md](Superstring%20theory.md), but no smooth or complex structures. 
  - Indirect approach: compactify an 11-dimension space, one small $S^1$ dimension to 10 dimensions, 
    - 4 from a spacetime and 6 from a "small" Calabi-Yau




- As manifolds: 

  - Yau, Fields Medal 1982: There are [Ricci%20curvature.md) but non-flat (nontrivial holonomy](Ricci%20curvature.md)%20but%20non-flat%20(nontrivial%20holonomy) projective complex manifolds of dimensions $\geq 2$.

- As varieties: the [canonical%20bundle.md](canonical%20bundle.md) $\Lambda^n T\dual V$ is trivial

- Compact classification for $\CC\dash$dimension:
  - Dimension 1: 1 type, all elliptic curves (up to homeomorphism)
  - Dimension 2: 1 type, [K3%20Surface](K3%20Surface)
  - Dimension 3: (threefolds) conjectured to be a bounded number, but unknown.

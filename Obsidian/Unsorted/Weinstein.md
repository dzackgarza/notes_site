**Definition (Weinstein Surgery):**
Let $(W, \lambda)$ be a Liouville domain (although we won't need compactness).

> Recall: $(W, \lambda)$ is a $2n\dash$dimensional exact symplectic manifold with contact-type boundary $\bd W$ such that the Liouville vector field $X$ points outwards along $\bd W$.

Weinstein surgery takes 

- $(W, \lambda)$ a $2n\dash$dimensional manifold
- That is exact and symplectic
- With contact-type boundary $\bd W$
- Where the Liouville vector field points outward along $\bd W$

and produces a distinct manifold $(W(\Lambda), \lambda')$ with the above properties which is obtained by surgery along $\Lambda$ an isotropic embedded sphere.
Thus $W(\Lambda)$ is obtained from attaching a $k\dash$handle to $W$ along $\Lambda$.

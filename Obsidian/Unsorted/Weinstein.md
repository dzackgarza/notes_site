**Definition (Weinstein Surgery):** Let $(W, \lambda)$ be a Liouville domain (although we won't need compactness).

> Recall: $(W, \lambda)$ is a $2n{\hbox{-}}$dimensional exact symplectic manifold with contact-type boundary ${{\partial}}W$ such that the Liouville vector field $X$ points outwards along ${{\partial}}W$.

Weinstein surgery takes

-   $(W, \lambda)$ a $2n{\hbox{-}}$dimensional manifold
-   That is exact and symplectic
-   With contact-type boundary ${{\partial}}W$
-   Where the Liouville vector field points outward along ${{\partial}}W$

and produces a distinct manifold $(W(\Lambda), \lambda')$ with the above properties which is obtained by surgery along $\Lambda$ an isotropic embedded sphere. Thus $W(\Lambda)$ is obtained from attaching a $k{\hbox{-}}$handle to $W$ along $\Lambda$.

**Theorem:** Every compact [[3-manifold.md) arises as a combination of (2 different variants of | Three-manifold.html]] arises as a combination of (2 different variants of) Weinstein surgeries on $S^3$.

> The connections between [[chromatic%20homotopy%20theory.md) are key. Read Quillen's paper, J.F. Adams' blue book, Ravenel, etc. Ravenel has some slides on Quillen's work (good entry pt | chromatic%20homotopy%20theory.html]]%20are%20key.%20Read%20Quillen's%20paper,%20J.F.%20Adams'%20blue%20book,%20Ravenel,%20etc.%20Ravenel%20has%20some%20slides%20on%20Quillen's%20work%20(good%20entry%20pt). If you really want to go in depth, I enjoyed learning from Hazewinkel's book "Formal Groups and Applications".

# Notes

-   Def: ?

-   From Tyler Genao: for $(R, {\mathfrak{m}})$ is a complete [local%20ring](local%20ring), can plug ${\mathfrak{m}}$ into a formal group law to construct a group whose underlying set is ${\mathfrak{m}}$

    -   Makes the power series converge.

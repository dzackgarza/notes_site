A **closed immersion** is a morphism $f\in {\mathsf{Sch}}(Y, X)$ such that - The induced map $\tilde f \in {\mathsf{Top}}( {\left\lvert {X} \right\rvert}, {\left\lvert {Y} \right\rvert})$ is a homeomorphism onto a closed subset of ${\left\lvert {Y} \right\rvert}$, - The induced map $f^* \in {\mathsf{Sh}}_X({\mathcal{O}}_X, f_* {\mathcal{O}}_Y)$ is a surjection.

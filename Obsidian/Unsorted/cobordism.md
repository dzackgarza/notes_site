# Motivation

- Can I find a list of all manifolds up to diffeomorphism? No. 
- Weaken to homeomorphism? Still no. 
- Weaken to [homotopy equivalence](homotopy%20equivalence). Still pretty much no. 
- A really weak notion: [cobordism](cobordism.md).

There is a sequence of spaces, $\MO(n)$, and maps $\Sigma \MO(n)\to \MO(n+1)$ such that the $k$th stable homotopy groups of this spectrum are isomorphic to the [stable%20framing.md](stable%20framing.md) you get the [stable homotopy groups of spheres](stable%20homotopy%20groups%20of%20spheres.md).

> Note: bordism is one of the coarsest equivalence relations we can put on manifolds. Hope to understand completely!

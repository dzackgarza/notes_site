Motivation
==========

-   Can I find a list of all manifolds up to diffeomorphism? No.Â 
-   Weaken to homeomorphism? Still no.
-   Weaken to [homotopy equivalence](homotopy%20equivalence). Still pretty much no.
-   A really weak notion: [[cobordism | cobordism.html]].

There is a sequence of spaces, ${\operatorname{MO}}(n)$, and maps $\Sigma {\operatorname{MO}}(n)\to {\operatorname{MO}}(n+1)$ such that the $k$th stable homotopy groups of this spectrum are isomorphic to the [[stable%20framing.md](stable%20framing.md) you get the [stable homotopy groups of spheres | stable%20homotopy%20groups%20of%20spheres.html]].

> Note: bordism is one of the coarsest equivalence relations we can put on manifolds. Hope to understand completely!

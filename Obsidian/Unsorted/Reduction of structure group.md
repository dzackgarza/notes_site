-   For $\xi = (E \xrightarrow{p} B)$ a real $n{\hbox{-}}$plane bundle, $E$ is orientable iff $?$
-   A principal ${\operatorname{SO}}_n$ bundle lifts to a principal ${\operatorname{Spin}}_n$ bundle iff the 2nd Stiefel-Whitney class vanishes, $w_2(P) \in H^2(X; {\mathbb{F}}_2)$.
    -   Choices of spin structures biject with $H^1(X; {\mathbb{F}}_2)$.

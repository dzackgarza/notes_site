-   The questions on existence and classification of spin structures may be completely answered in terms of the Stiefel--Whitney classes.
-   Spinnable (admits spin structure) implies admitting a $\mathrm{Spin}^{{c} }$ structure, but not conversely
-   Every closed oriented 4-manifold admits a $\mathrm{Spin}^{{c} }$ structure
    -   There are closed non-oriented manifolds that are not spinnable
-   Every closed oriented is spinnable.

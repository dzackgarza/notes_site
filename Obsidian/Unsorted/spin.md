- The questions on existence and classification of spin structures may be completely answered in terms of the Stiefelâ€“Whitney classes.
- Spinnable (admits spin structure) implies admitting a $\Spinc$ structure, but not conversely 
- Every closed oriented 4-manifold admits a $\Spinc$ structure
	- There are closed non-oriented manifolds that are not spinnable
- Every closed oriented is spinnable.

# Notes
- One can say a great deal about the moduli space purely in terms of the moduli functor without even knowing the moduli space exists 
	- For example, the [dual%20numbers](dual%20numbers). $\spec k\dualnumbers$

- Prototypical example of a moduli space: the [Grassmannian.md)  $\Gr_\CC(n, k](Grassmannian.md)%20%20$/Gr_/CC(n,%20k)$.
- Common example: the [Hilbert%20scheme](Hilbert%20scheme).
- Apparently a [fundamental%20class](fundamental%20class) exists for closed subvarieties? 
Maybe just closed subvarieties of a moduli space?

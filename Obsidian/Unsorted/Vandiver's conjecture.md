Kummer showed that if a prime $p$ does not divide the class number $h$, then Fermat's Last Theorem holds for exponent $p$.

The Kummerâ€“Vandiver conjecture states that $p$ does not divide the second factor $h_2$. Kummer showed that if $p$ divides the second factor, then $p$ also divides the first factor.

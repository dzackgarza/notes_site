## Smooth Category: Geometrization

3-manifolds: Thurston's Geometrization - Geometric structure: a diffeo $M\cong \tilde M/\Gamma$ where $\Gamma$ is a discrete Lie group acting freely/transitively on $X$ (as in Erlangen program) - Oriented prime 3-manifolds can be decomposed into geometric "pieces" of 8 possible types: - Spherical $\sim S^3$ - Euclidean $\sim {\mathbb{R}}^3$ - Hyperbolic $\sim {\mathbb{H}}^3$ - $S^2\times{\mathbb{R}}$ - ${\mathbb{H}}^2\times{\mathbb{R}}$ - $\tilde{{\operatorname{SL}}(2, {\mathbb{R}})}$ - "Nil" - "Sol"

-   Proved by Perelman 2003, Ricci flow with surgery.

-   4-manifolds: classified in the topological category by surgery, but not in the smooth category

    -   Hard! Will examine special cases of Calabi-Yau
    -   Open part of Poincar√© Conjecture.

-   Dimension $\geq 5$: surgery theory, diffeomorphic $\iff$ s-cobordant

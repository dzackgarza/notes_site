## Smooth Category: Geometrization

3-manifolds: Thurston's Geometrization
- Geometric structure: a diffeo $M\cong \tilde M/\Gamma$ where $\Gamma$ is a discrete Lie group acting freely/transitively on $X$ (as in Erlangen program)
- Oriented prime 3-manifolds can be decomposed into geometric "pieces" of 8 possible types:
  - Spherical $\sim S^3$
  - Euclidean $\sim \RR^3$
  - Hyperbolic $\sim \HH^3$
  - $S^2\cross \RR$
  - $\HH^2\cross \RR$
  - $\tilde{\SL(2, \RR)}$
  - "Nil"
  - "Sol"

- Proved by Perelman 2003, Ricci flow with surgery.

- 4-manifolds: classified in the topological category by surgery, but not in the smooth category
  - Hard! Will examine special cases of Calabi-Yau
  - Open part of Poincar√© Conjecture.
- Dimension $\geq 5$: surgery theory, diffeomorphic  $\iff$ s-cobordant

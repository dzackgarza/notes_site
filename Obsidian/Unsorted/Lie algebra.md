On the cohomology of Lie algebras, from Brian Boe:

> I haven’t been able to find a good reference relating the cohomology of [Lie groups](Lie%20groups) and Lie algebras. The closest I’ve found is the book *"Lie groups, Lie algebras, and cohomology*” by Anthony W. Knapp, Princeton Univ Press, 1988. 
> He focuses on Lie algebra cohomology, but does discuss some motivation in terms of [vector%20field) on manifolds (Lie groups](vector%20field)%20on%20manifolds%20(Lie%20groups), de Rham complex, etc. There are also a couple of chapters on homological algebra with applications to Lie algebras, which might be helpful in the context of my course this semester.

> It’s also likely that some of the references in Knapp’s book would contain the sort of comparison information you’re looking for (maybe Borel & Wallach, or Brown?), but I’m not familiar with those.

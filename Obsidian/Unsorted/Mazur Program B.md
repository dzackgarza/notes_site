Classify all elliptic curves with Galois groups of some form? Classify l-adic images of Galois.

-   Find subgroups $H$that occur as the image of Galois
-   Compute equations for modular curves $X_H$
-   Determine rational $j$ invariants $j_H: X_H \to X(1) \cong {\mathbb{P}}^1_{/{\mathbb{Q}}}$
-   Provably find all rational points on each $X_H$.

Sporadic: not cuspidal and not [[complex%20multiplication.md | complex%20multiplication.html]] Compute genus using [Riemann-Hurwitz](Riemann-Hurwitz).

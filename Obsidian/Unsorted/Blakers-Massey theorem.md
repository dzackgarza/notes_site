-   There is a theorem of Blakers and Massey, sometimes called [homotopy excision](homotopy%20excision) which says the following:
    -   Even though taking homotopy groups does not take [[cofiber%20sequence.md | cofiber%20sequence.html]].

        In particular, if we keep suspending the [[cofiber%20sequence.md) (in which case we're asking about stable homotopy groups | cofiber%20sequence.html]]%20%20(in%20which%20case%20we're%20asking%20about%20stable%20homotopy%20groups) then this is the case.

    Think about every time you make an argument in homology using the [long exact sequence of a pair](long%20exact%20sequence%20of%20a%20pair), you can now make that argument with stable homotopy groups, or any other nice spectrum, etc.

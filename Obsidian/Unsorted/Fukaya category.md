Description of a certain wrapped Fukaya category ${\mathcal{O}}$: take the objects to be [Lagrangian](Lagrangian) embedded curves, the morphisms are the graded abelian groups $\hom_{\mathcal{O}}\coloneqq\qty{\bigoplus_{L_0 \pitchfork L_1} {\mathbb{Z}}/2{\mathbb{Z}}, {{\partial}}}$ wher ${{\partial}}$ is given by counting holomorphic strips, localize along small isotopies.

A character of a representation $\phi: G\to V$ is defined as `
<span class="math display">
\begin{align*}
\chi_\phi(g) := \operatorname{Tr}(\phi(g))
,\end{align*}
<span>`{=html} i.e.Â by taking the trace of the image of $g$ in any basis.

Big result: An irreducible representation of a finite group $G$ is completely determined by its character.

-   There is likewise a natural categorification of the group algebra $\mathbb{C}[\Gamma]$, namely the monoidal category $\mathcal{D}(G)$ of $\mathcal{D}$ -modules on the group $G$ under convolution.
    -   Categorified: monoidal categories of sheaves on G with convolution
-   For a finite group, carries the structure of a symmetric [Frobenius%20algebra](Frobenius%20algebra)

## Notes on [Arithmetic%20Statistics](Arithmetic%20Statistics)

- Interesting question in arithmetic statistics: for $G \in \Grp$ finite, how many Galois extensions are there $K/\QQ$ with $G = \Gal(K/\QQ)$ and $\Delta \leq N$ ([Discriminant)](Discriminant)) for some fixed $N$?

- Example
	- For $G=\ZZ/2$, it is $O(N)$.
	- For $G=\ZZ/3$, it is $O(\sqrt N )$.

- One can ask a similar question about $\Cl(K)$ for $G\in \Ab$, or replacing $\QQ$ with [inert%20primes](inert%20primes).

- Cool fact: there is an [../curves.md](../curves.md) $C_{/k}$.
	- The (reverse) functor is the one sending a curve $C$ to its function field $k(C)$.

- $\eps$ is a $q^i$ [Weil%20number) if $\abs{ \iota(\eps](Weil%20number)%20if%20$/abs{%20/iota(/eps) } = q^{i/2}$ for any embedding $\iota: \Qbar \embeds \CC$.

## Old Notes: Erik Schreyer

> Some old notes from March 10th, 2020

I talked to [http://www.jasoncantarella.com/wordpress/), including his dissertation work (which he spoke about in the Geometry seminar last week](http://www.jasoncantarella.com/wordpress/),%20including%20his%20dissertation%20work%20(which%20he%20spoke%20about%20in%20the%20Geometry%20seminar%20last%20week) and a few other papers.

His dissertation work involved a cool way to represent arbitrary planar curves by *piecewise circular* arcs:

![image-20200310232110171](_attachments/image-20200310232110171.png)

From what I understand, this involves fixing a curve (blue), choosing a collection of circles $C_1, \cdots C_n$ (black) such that each $C_i$ intersects $C_{i+1}$ in at least one distinguished point $p_i$ (pink). The curve traced out by following an arc on $C_i$ and switching to circle $C_{i+1}$ at $p_i$ is intended to yield a good approximation to the original curve, with certain regularity conditions at the $p_i$ (such as the first derivatives along both arcs agreeing at the point).

Erik's work actually seems to go a bit farther -- he has an algorithm (a *curve-closing operator*) that actually takes an *open* curve and produces a closed curve that is nearby in the $C_1$ norm. He uses this to construct piecewise circular approximations that consist of circles of *equal* radii, along with some control over the $C^1$ distance between the original curve and the approximation.

We also talked a bit about another problem Jason was working on, discussed in the following papers:

- [https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.5924](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.5924)
- [https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02466](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02466)

## Dirichlet's Theorem

Dirichlet's Theorem: An arithmetic progress with $(a, p) = 1$ contains infinitely many primes.
As a corollary, one can always find a *prime* $q$ that generates $\ZZ_p\units$ for any prime $p$.

## A SES isomorphic to a direct sum that does not split

[http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1082283/example-of-a-non-splitting-exact-sequence-0-%E2%86%92-m-%E2%86%92-m-oplus-n-%E2%86%92-n-%E2%86%92-0/1082313 > 1082313](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1082283/example-of-a-non-splitting-exact-sequence-0-%E2%86%92-m-%E2%86%92-m-oplus-n-%E2%86%92-n-%E2%86%92-0/1082313#1082313) Not every sequence of the form $0\to A \to A \oplus C \to C \to 0$ splits; take
$$
0 \to \ZZ \to \ZZ \oplus \bigoplus_\NN \ZZ/(2) \to \bigoplus_\NN \ZZ/(2) \to 0
$$
where the first map is multiplication by 2, the second is the quotient map and a right-shift. This can't split because $(1, 0, \cdots)$ has order 2 in the RHS but pulls back to $(1, 0) \oplus (2\ZZ \oplus 0)$ which has no element of order 2.



## Cogroups

> Reference: [https://qchu.wordpress.com/2011/01/21/structures-on-hom-sets/](https://qchu.wordpress.com/2011/01/21/structures-on-hom-sets/)

- Group object: have structure maps
\[
m: G^{\times 2} &\to G \\
\eps: 1 &\to G \\
i: G &\to G
.\]
where 1 is a terminal (?) object.


- Cogroup objects: have structure maps
$$
m: H &\to H^{\times 2} \\
\eps: H &\to 0 \\
i: H &\to H
$$
where $0$ is an initial object.

- Example: $S^n \in \ho\Top$.

- **Importance**: What structure does $H$ need to have such that $\hom(H,\wait)$ has a group structure when applied? The answer is that $H$ is a group object in $\mathcal{C}\op$, or equivalently that $H$ is a cogroup object in $\mathcal{C}$.

- The forgetful functor $U: \Set\to\Grp$ is representable by $\hom_{\Grp}(\ZZ, \wait)$, and the coproduct in $\Grp$ is the free product.

- Recall that $\CRing\op \cong \Sch(\Aff)$, the category of affine schemes.

- The adjoint to the forgetful functor $\CRing \to \Set$ is the free commutative ring on $X$, i.e. $\ZZ[X]$, and is thus representable. The forgetful functor $\CRing \to \Ab$ given by sending a ring to its underlying abelian group is also representable, namely by $\hom_{\Ring}(\ZZ[x], \wait)$. The coproduct in $\Ring$ is the tensor product over $\ZZ$, and the initial object is $\ZZ$.

- $\ZZ[x]$ with its cogroup structure defines the structure of an affine group scheme on $\spec \ZZ[x]$, which represents the "additive group" functor and is called the additive group scheme $\GG_a$. Dualizing, an affine group scheme in the category $\CRing$ is precisely a Hopf algebra.

- Similarly, the forgetful functor $\CRing \to \Ab$ given by sending $R$ to $R\units$ is representable by 
\[
\Hom_{\Ring}(\ZZ[x, x\inv], \wait)
\] 
and the corresponding affine group scheme $\spec \ZZ[x, x \inv]$ is the multiplicative group scheme $\GG_m$.

- Note: the functor $\Sch(\Aff) \to \Set$ sending a ring to its set of prime ideals is not representable (and doesn't preserve products), but the functor 
\[
\Hom_{\Sch(\Aff)}(\spec k, \wait)
\]
sending a scheme to its $k\dash$points for any $k$ is representable (and preserves all limits).

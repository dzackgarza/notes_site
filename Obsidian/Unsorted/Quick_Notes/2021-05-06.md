> Reference: Arpon Raksit - Hochschild homology and the derived de Rham complex revisited. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E84gVDm1kvM>

-   [[Algebraic%20de%20Rham%20complex | ../Algebraic%20de%20Rham%20complex.html]]: ![image_2021-05-06-11-15-55](_attachments/image_2021-05-06-11-15-55.png)

-   Can get a derived version: take *non-abelian derived functors*, i.e. take a [[../simplicial%20resolution.md | ../simplicial%20resolution.html]] by simplicial polynomial algebras and apply the functor to the resolution.

    -   Equivalently a left [[../Kan%20extension.md | ../Kan%20extension.html]]?

-   Define $\mathop{\mathrm{{\mathbb{L} }}}\Omega^1 _{A/R}$ to be the [[../cotangent%20complex.md | ../cotangent%20complex.html]] and take derived exterior powers for the other degrees.

-   Derived [Hodge%20filtration) may not be complete, so take completion: take cone (cofiber?](Hodge%20filtration)%20may%20not%20be%20complete,%20so%20take%20completion:%20take%20cone%20(cofiber?) in derived category and take a hocolim.

-   Fact: de Rham complex has a universal property, initial (strictly, so odd elements square to zero) commutative [[../differential%20graded%20algebras.md | ../differential%20graded%20algebras.html]] receiving a map $A\to X^0$, so the initial way to turn an algebra into a DGA. Does the derived version have a similar property?

-   [cyclic%20homology](cyclic%20homology).

-   Associated graded of ${\mathbb{H}}$ recovers derived de Rham:

![image_2021-05-06-11-25-44](_attachments/image_2021-05-06-11-25-44.png)

-   Why does this happen? ${\mathbb{H}}(A/R)$ is the initial [[../simplicial%20algebra.md | ../simplicial%20algebra.html]] with an $S^1{\hbox{-}}$action receiving a map from $A$.
-   Analogies
    -   [[../differential%20graded%20algebras.md | ../differential%20graded%20algebras.html]]
    -   $S^1$ action $\rightleftharpoons$ the differential
-   Can take homotopy groups of ${\mathbb{H}}$????

> Reference: Andrew Blumberg, Floer homotopy theory and Morava K-theory. Princeton Algebraic Topology Seminar

-   Topic: [Floer%20homotopy%20theory](Floer%20homotopy%20theory)

-   Some relevant things about [[../Morava%20K-theory.md | ../Morava%20K-theory.html]], which will be coefficients that we take.

![Tate construction and homotopy orbits/fixed points in the norm map](_attachments/image_2021-05-06-13-11-30.png)

-   Produce a virtual fundamental class for flow categories. Moduli spaces of trajectories appearing will be "derived [[../orbifold.md | ../orbifold.html]]".

    -   Use some derived/spectral version of the usual [Novikov%20ring](Novikov%20ring)?

-   Flow category: ![image_2021-05-06-13-15-11](_attachments/image_2021-05-06-13-15-11.png)

    -   Enriched in spaces
    -   Use a so-called *Kuranishi flow category*.
    -   Uses [norm%20map](norm%20map)

-   Where do flow categories come from? One natural source: Morse functions. Objects are critical points, morphisms are roughly trajectories.

-   Given a functor $\mathsf{C} \to {\mathsf{Sp}}$ out of a flow category, can construct a spectrum as a $\mathop{\mathrm{hocolim}}$. Turns Floer data into stable homotopy data?

![image_2021-05-06-13-17-37](_attachments/image_2021-05-06-13-17-37.png)

-   Defining a flow category:

![image_2021-05-06-13-18-44](_attachments/image_2021-05-06-13-18-44.png)

-   Morphisms are moduli spaces of Floer trajectories, i.e. flow lines using the symplectic form?

-   Action map $A: P\to {\mathbb{R}}$ given by integration, objects of $P$ form a poset.

-   Action induces a filtration $P_{ \lambda} \coloneqq\left\{{ p\in P {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}A(p) < \lambda}\right\}$.

-   Get filtered modules, need to work with a completion of this filtration. Tough to build/describe, uses point-set language and zigzags. Maybe easier in infty-categorical language?

-   Get an $E_2$ ring spectrum -- not great! But there is an Ore condition that makes things nicer.

-   Can express enrichments in terms of [[../lax%20functor.md | ../lax%20functor.html]] from an indexing 2-category

    -   Cats of objects of set type $S$ and morphism type $V$ are lax functors from some indiscrete indexing 2-category (associated to $S$?) to a [bicategory](bicategory) associated to $V$.
    -   Lax functors of bicategories: yikes.
    -   A lot of [homotopy%20coherence](homotopy%20coherence) problems to deal with.

-   How does one construct the [virtual%20fundamental%20class](virtual%20fundamental%20class)? Under orientability hypothesis, have some kind of [Alexander%20duality](Alexander%20duality).

![image_2021-05-06-13-32-51](_attachments/image_2021-05-06-13-32-51.png)

-   See the [[../ambidexterity.md | ../ambidexterity.html]].

    -   Orientability hypothesis allows using the [equivariant%20cobordism](equivariant%20cobordism). See [complex%20stability](complex%20stability).
    -   Uses some model of iterated cones, similar to Khovanov stuff?

-   Cover moduli space by Kuranishi charts $(X, G, s, Y)$

    -   Symmetric monoidal structure is basically component-wise.
    -   Morphisms are complicated, essentially involves transversality conditions (free actions, topological submersions, etc).
    -   Stronger requirements than what John Pardon (?) imposes in his work on [virtual%20fundamental%20classes](virtual%20fundamental%20classes).

-   Technical issues with loop actions on categories, only get module structure on homotopy category?

    -   Also issues with local-to-global coherence, need $\mathop{\mathrm{hocolim}}$ to be compatible with Kuranishi atlases? And technical tools like [[norm%20map](norm%20map). Need lots of [../equivariant%20stable%20homotopy%20theory.md | ../equivariant%20stable%20homotopy%20theory.html]].
    -   Substantial difficulties extracting this data from the symplectic structure.
        -   "This data": stratified oriented Kuranishi structures?
    -   Build a spectrum with some [[bar%20construction | ../bar%20construction.html]].

-   Can get the [[Arnold%20conjecture](../Arnold%20conjecture.md) from this homotopy type! I.e. $\operatorname{rank}\operatorname{HF}_*(H, \Lambda) \leq \#\text{ orbits}$, here we're taking homotopy groups. $H$ is a [../Hamiltonian.md | ../Hamiltonian.html]].

    -   Can split $H_*(M; \Lambda)$ off from $\operatorname{HF}_*(H; \Lambda)$.

    -   Recover statement about $\operatorname{HF}_p$ cohomology using the [[../Atiyah%20Hirzebruch%20spectral%20sequence.md | ../Atiyah%20Hirzebruch%20spectral%20sequence.html]].

-   Technical problems: virtual cochains are not functorial in morphisms of Kuranishi charts. No canonical map between certain cofibers. There are maps, they require choices, tracking them is tough.

    -   Solution: degenerate to the [zigzags](zigzags).

    -   Sits between two Kuranishi charts by looking at the ends of the cone.

-   A lot of cool stuff for homotopy theorists to do here!

    -   See Cohen-Jones-Segal.

    -   Homotopy theory should yield interesting symplectic consequences.

    -   Work to build spectrally enriched [[../Fukaya%20category.md | ../Fukaya%20category.html]].

    -   Should be doing [global%20homotopy%20theory](global%20homotopy%20theory) or global homology, yielding a nicer way to describe all of this. Rezk is a proponent!

    -   Can one do this over other spectra? Need strong [[../Orientability%20of%20spectra.md | ../Orientability%20of%20spectra.html]] conditions. Don't expect a lift to the [sphere%20spectrum](sphere%20spectrum), but maybe ${\operatorname{ku}}, \mu$.

-   Improvement over rational results when there is torsion. May not improve over numerical bounds for special classes of [[../Symplectic%20geometry.md | ../Symplectic%20geometry.html]].

-   [[../Morava%20K-theory.md | ../Morava%20K-theory.html]] is useful here because it behaves well with respect to finite groups

    -   Want to dualize [[../orbifold.md | ../orbifold.html]], use Poincaré duality for orbifolds. Equivariant stuff appears as an alternative to going to $H_*(X; {\mathbb{Q}})$.

-   Comment by Morava: the $p=2$ case may be resolvable, see Boardman's last paper. Set up some category of modules over the $p=2$ [Bockstein](Bockstein).

    -   $E/{\mathbb{F}}$ a quadratic extension of number fields, so ${ \mathsf{Gal}} (E/{\mathbb{F}}) \cong {\mathbb{Z}}/2 = \left\{{ 1, c }\right\}$.

-   
-   Can get a derived version: take *non-abelian derived functors*, i.e. take a \[\[../simplicial resolution\]\] by simplicial polynomial algebras and apply the functor to the resolution.
    -   Equivalently a left \[\[../Kan extension\]\]?
-   Define $\mathop{\mathrm{{\mathbb{L} }}}\Omega^1 _{A/R}$ to be the \[\[Unsorted/cotangent complex\]\] and take derived exterior powers for the other degrees.
-   Derived \[\[Hodge filtration\]\] may not be complete, so take completion: take cone (cofiber?) in derived category and take a hocolim.

-   Fact: de Rham complex has a universal property, initial (strictly, so odd elements square to zero) commutative \[\[../differential graded algebras\]\] receiving a map $A\to X^0$, so the initial way to turn an algebra into a DGA. Does the derived version have a similar property?

-   \[\[cyclic homology\]\].

-   Associated graded of ${\mathbb{H}}$ recovers derived de Rham:

![image_2021-05-06-11-25-44](_attachments/image_2021-05-06-11-25-44.png)

-   Why does this happen? ${\mathbb{H}}(A/R)$ is the initial \[\[../simplicial algebra\]\] with an $S^1{\hbox{-}}$action receiving a map from $A$.
-   Analogies
    -   \[\[../differential graded algebras\]\]
    -   $S^1$ action $\rightleftharpoons$ the differential
-   Can take homotopy groups of ${\mathbb{H}}$????

> Reference: Andrew Blumberg, Floer homotopy theory and Morava K-theory. Princeton Algebraic Topology Seminar

-   Topic: \[\[Floer homotopy theory\]\]

-   Some relevant things about \[\[../Morava K-theory\]\], which will be coefficients that we take.

![Tate construction and homotopy orbits/fixed points in the norm map](_attachments/image_2021-05-06-13-11-30.png)

-   Produce a virtual fundamental class for flow categories. Moduli spaces of trajectories appearing will be "derived \[\[../orbifold\]\]".

    -   Use some derived/spectral version of the usual \[\[Novikov ring\]\]?

-   Flow category: ![image_2021-05-06-13-15-11](_attachments/image_2021-05-06-13-15-11.png)

    -   Enriched in spaces
    -   Use a so-called \[\[Kuranishi flow category\]\].
    -   Uses \[\[norm map\]\]

-   Where do flow categories come from? One natural source: Morse functions. Objects are critical points, morphisms are roughly trajectories.

-   Given a functor $\mathsf{C} \to {\mathsf{Sp}}$ out of a flow category, can construct a spectrum as a $\mathop{\mathrm{hocolim}}$. Turns Floer data into stable homotopy data?

-   Defining a flow category:

![image_2021-05-06-13-18-44](_attachments/image_2021-05-06-13-18-44.png)

-   Morphisms are moduli spaces of Floer trajectories, i.e. flow lines using the symplectic form?

-   Action map $A: P\to {\mathbb{R}}$ given by integration, objects of $P$ form a poset.

-   Action induces a filtration $P_{ \lambda} \coloneqq\left\{{ p\in P {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}A(p) < \lambda}\right\}$.

-   Get filtered modules, need to work with a completion of this filtration. Tough to build/describe, uses point-set language and zigzags. Maybe easier in infty-categorical language?

-   Get an $E_2$ ring spectrum -- not great! But there is an Ore condition that makes things nicer.

-   Can express enrichments in terms of \[\[../lax functor\]\] from an indexing 2-category

    -   Cats of objects of set type $S$ and morphism type $V$ are lax functors from some indiscrete indexing 2-category (associated to $S$?) to a \[\[bicategory\]\] associated to $V$.
    -   Lax functors of bicategories: yikes.
    -   A lot of \[\[homotopy coherence\]\] problems to deal with.

-   How does one construct the \[\[virtual fundamental class\]\]? Under orientability hypothesis, have some kind of \[\[Alexander duality\]\].

![image_2021-05-06-13-32-51](_attachments/image_2021-05-06-13-32-51.png)

-   See the \[\[../ambidexterity\]\].

    -   Orientability hypothesis allows using the \[\[equivariant cobordism\]\]. See \[\[complex stability\]\].
    -   Uses some model of iterated cones, similar to Khovanov stuff?

-   Cover moduli space by Kuranishi charts $(X, G, s, Y)$

    -   Symmetric monoidal structure is basically component-wise.
    -   Morphisms are complicated, essentially involves transversality conditions (free actions, topological submersions, etc).
    -   Stronger requirements than what John Pardon (?) imposes in his work on \[\[virtual fundamental classes\]\].

-   Technical issues with loop actions on categories, only get module structure on homotopy category?

    -   Also issues with local-to-global coherence, need $\mathop{\mathrm{hocolim}}$ to be compatible with Kuranishi atlases? And technical tools like \[\[norm map\]\]. Need lots of \[\[../equivariant stable homotopy theory\]\].
    -   Substantial difficulties extracting this data from the symplectic structure.
        -   "This data": stratified oriented Kuranishi structures?
    -   Build a spectrum with some \[\[../bar construction\]\].

-   Can get the \[\[../Arnold conjecture\]\] from this homotopy type! I.e. $\operatorname{rank}\operatorname{HF}_*(H, \Lambda) \leq \#\text{ orbits}$, here we're taking homotopy groups. $H$ is a \[\[../Hamiltonian\]\].

    -   Can split $H_*(M; \Lambda)$ off from $\operatorname{HF}_*(H; \Lambda)$.

    -   Recover statement about $\operatorname{HF}_p$ cohomology using the \[\[../Atiyah Hirzebruch spectral sequence\]\].

-   Technical problems: virtual cochains are not functorial in morphisms of Kuranishi charts. No canonical map between certain cofibers. There are maps, they require choices, tracking them is tough.

    -   Solution: degenerate to the \[\[zigzags\]\].

    -   Sits between two Kuranishi charts by looking at the ends of the cone.

-   A lot of cool stuff for homotopy theorists to do here!

    -   See Cohen-Jones-Segal.

    -   Homotopy theory should yield interesting symplectic consequences.

    -   Work to build spectrally enriched \[\[../Fukaya category\]\].

    -   Should be doing \[\[global homotopy theory\]\] or global homology, yielding a nicer way to describe all of this. Rezk is a proponent!

    -   Can one do this over other spectra? Need strong \[\[../Orientability of spectra\]\] conditions. Don't expect a lift to the \[\[sphere spectrum\]\], but maybe ${\operatorname{ku}}, \mu$.

-   Improvement over rational results when there is torsion. May not improve over numerical bounds for special classes of \[\[../Symplectic geometry\]\].

-   \[\[../Morava K-theory\]\] is useful here because it behaves well with respect to finite groups

    -   Want to dualize \[\[../orbifold\]\], use Poincaré duality for orbifolds. Equivariant stuff appears as an alternative to going to $H_*(X; {\mathbb{Q}})$.

-   Comment by Morava: the $p=2$ case may be resolvable, see Boardman's last paper. Set up some category of modules over the $p=2$ \[\[Bockstein\]\].

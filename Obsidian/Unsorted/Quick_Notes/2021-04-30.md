## Varieties with prescribed Hodge numbers

> Reference: Remy van Dobben de Bruyn (Princeton and IAS), "Constructing varieties with prescribed Hodge numbers modulo m in positive characteristic". Stanford AG Seminar.

- One of Serre's tricks: use group quotients cleverly.

- There is a way to directly add/subtract/multiply Hodge diamonds.

- Inverse Hodge problem: when can a Hodge diamond be realized by a smooth projective variety?
  Very hard problem.
  Want to use this to get information about $h_{\crys}$.

- Easier question: look at linear/polynomial relations satisfied by all Hodge diamonds of $\Vark(\smooth, \proj)$?


- Main theorems: for a fixed dimension $n$,

  - Linear relations are spanned by Serre duality in positive characteristic.
  - In $\ch(k) > 0$, the only polynomial relations are $h^{0,0} = 1$ and Serre Duality.
  - In $\ch(k) = 0$, one has to add in Hodge symmetry.

- Important tools:
  - Kunneth formula for Hodge diamonds: there's a graphical way to do this by summing over several different ways to place blocks in the diamonds.
  - Blowups: \[
h(\Bl_2 X) 
  &= h(X) - h(z) + h(E) \\
  &= h(X) - h(z) + h(z)(1 + \LL + \LL^2 + \cdots + \LL^{c-1} )\\
  &= h(z) + (\LL + \LL^2 + \cdots + \LL^{c-1} )
  \]
  where $z$ is the point removed and $E$ is the exceptional divisor.


## l-adic Representations

- Too many primes with supersingular reduction implies CM.
  Primes are supersingular about half of the time.

- Open image theorems: not known for abelian varieties in general.

-   Modular forms can be defined as functions ${\mathbb{H}}\to {\mathbb{C}}$ satisfying weak $\Gamma{\hbox{-}}$invariance.

-   Also sections of a bundle: the [[../modular%20curve.md | ../modular%20curve.html]].

-   [Weight%20of%20a%20modular%20form](Weight%20of%20a%20modular%20form): refers to growth rates of these functions.

    -   A weight $k$ modular form is an element of $H^0(X; \omega^{\otimes k})$ where $X$ is the compactified modular curve, a quotient of $H \cup{\mathbb{P}}^1({\mathbb{Q}})$
        -   This definition extends to $H/\Gamma$

-   Weird fact: $M_1$ is one-dimensional, but for $g\geq 2$ we have $\dim M_g = 3g-3$

    -   Special things for $g=1$: $q {\hbox{-}}$expansions (i.e. Fourier seres), vanishing [Torelli](Torelli), $\pi_1 {\mathbb{T}}$ for the torus is abelian, the $\theta$ function has a discrete zero locus, infinite product expansions like Jacobi's triple product

-   Higher genus generalizations come not from a Teichmüller cover $T_g \twoheadrightarrow M_g$ or $M_g$, no one seems to care about those though.

    -   People do care about [Siegel%20modular%20forms](Siegel%20modular%20forms): replace ${\mathbb{H}}$ with ${\mathbb{H}}_S^g$ the symmetric $g\times g$ matrices with positive-definite imaginary part

-   ${\mathbb{H}}_S^g/{\mathsf{Sp}}(2g; {\mathbb{Z}})$ is somehow a model for [[../Jacobian.md | ../Jacobian.html]]

-   [[../canonical%20bundle.md | ../canonical%20bundle.html]], then take the determinant bundle.

    -   Surprisingly, ${\mathbb{H}}_S^g$ is a [[../Lie%20algebra.md | ../Lie%20algebra.html]]: $[AB]^t = -[BA]^t$, so it's not closed.

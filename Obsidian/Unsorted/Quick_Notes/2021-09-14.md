Terms:

-   Cartan subgroup

    -   Centralizer of a maximal torus.

-   Borel subgroup

    -   Maximal connected solvable subgroup
    -   Why care: critical to structure theory of simple reductive algebraic group. Uses pairs $(B, N)$ where $N = N_G(T)$ is the normalizer of a maximal torus.

-   Parabolic subgroup

    -   Literally any $P\leq G$ such that $B \subseteq P \subseteq G$
    -   $G/P$ is a complete variety, so all projections $X\times ({-}) \to ({-})$ are closed maps.
    -   $G/B$ is the largest complete variety since $B \subseteq P$ for all $P$.

-   Local field

    -   Complete with respect to a topology induced by $v$ a discrete valuation with $\kappa$ finite.

-   Valuation: $v: k \to G\cup\left\{{\infty}\right\}$, $G\in {\mathsf{Ab}}$ totally ordered.

    -   Value group: $\operatorname{im}v$
    -   Valuation ring: $R_v \coloneqq\left\{{v(x) \geq 0}\right\}$
    -   Prime/maximal ideal: ${\mathfrak{m}}_v \coloneqq\left\{{v(x)>0}\right\}$
    -   Residue field $\kappa_v \coloneqq R_v/{\mathfrak{m}}_v$
    -   Places: $\left\{{v}\right\}/\sim$ where $v_2\sim v_1 \iff v_2 = \phi \circ v_1$.
    -   Uniformizer: for $R$ a DVR, a generator $\pi$ for the unique maximal ideal, so $R^{\times}\left\langle{\pi}\right\rangle = R$ and $x\in R \implies x = u\pi^k$

-   Global field: algebraic number fields, function fields of algebraic curves over finite fields (so finite extensions of ${\mathbb{F}}_q { \left( {(} \right) } t))$.

    -   For a 1-dim variety: $\operatorname{ff}k[X]$, the fraction field of the coordinate ring.

-   Note the closed point of $\operatorname{Spec}{ {\mathbb{Z}}_p }$ is ${\mathbb{F}}_p$ and the generic point is ${ {\mathbb{Q}}_p }$.

-   Nonarchimedean field

    -   Existence of infinitesimals, i.e. for a ${\mathbb{Z}}{\hbox{-}}$module with a linear order, $x$ is infinitesimal with respect to $y$ if $nx < y$ for all $n$
    -   E.g. ${\mathbb{R}} { \left( {(} \right) } x)$ or ${\mathbb{Q}} { \left( {(} \right) } x)$, $1/x$ is infinitesimal. Or ${ {\mathbb{Q}}_p }$.
    -   Nonarchimedean local fields are totally disconnected.

-   Proper morphism

    -   Separated, finite type, universally closed (so for $X\to Y$, all projections $X{ \underset{\scriptscriptstyle {Y} }{\times} }Z\to Z)$ are closed maps).
    -   For spaces: preimages of compact subspaces are compact.
    -   For locally compact Hausdorff spaces: continuous and closed with compact fibers.

-   Iwahori subgroup

    -   Subgroup of an algebraic group over a nonarchimedean local field, analogous to a Borel.

-   Fun fact: $p{\hbox{-}}$torsion in an ideal class group was the main obstruction to a direct proof of FLT. Observed by Kummer.

    -   Motivates defining $K_\infty \coloneqq\colim_n L(\mu_{p^{n+1}})$, using ${ \mathsf{Gal}} (K_n{}_{/ {K}} ) = C_{p^n}$ so $G\coloneqq{ \mathsf{Gal}} (K_\infty {}_{/ {K}} ) = { {\mathbb{Z}}_p }$. Set $I_n = { \operatorname{cl}} (K_n)[p]$ to be the $p{\hbox{-}}$torsion in the ideal class group of $K_n$, form $I\coloneqq\colim_n I_n$ using norm maps to get module structure, recover info about ${ \operatorname{cl}} (K)[p]$.

-   Main conjecture of Iwasawa theory: two methods of defining $p{\hbox{-}}$adic $L{\hbox{-}}$functions should coincide. Proved by Mazur/Wiles for ${\mathbb{Q}}$, all totally real number fields by Wiles.

    -   One defining method: interpolate special values.

-   Actual definition of Dirichlet characters:

-   Fundamental lemma in Langlands
    -   Relates orbital integrals on a reductive group over a local field, to "stable" orbital integrals on its endoscopic groups.
        -   Endoscope: $H\leq G$ a quasi-split group whose Langlands dual $H {}^{ \vee }$ is the connected component of $C_{G {}^{ \vee }}(x)$ for $x\in G {}^{ \vee }$ some semisimple element.
    -   Want to get at automorphic forms and the arithmetic of Shimura varieties
    -   Some "stabilized" version of the Grothendieck-Lefschetz trace formula?

-   Geometric fiber

-   Reductive, semisimple, simply connected, etc for $G\in{\mathsf{Grp}}{\mathsf{Sch}}_{/ {S}} $: affine and smooth over $S$, where geometric fibers are reductive. s.s., etc algebraic groups.

-   Etale morphisms

    -   For $f \in \mathop{\mathrm{Mor}}_{\mathsf{Sch}}(X, Y)$ finite type and $X, Y$ locally Noetherian, $f$ is etale at $y\in Y$ if $f^*: {\mathcal{O}}_{f(y)} \to {\mathcal{O}}_y$ is flat and ${\mathcal{O}}_{f(y)}/{\mathfrak{m}}_{f(y)} \to {\mathcal{O}}_{f(y)}/ f^*({\mathfrak{m}}_{f(y)} {\mathcal{O}}_y)$ is a finite separable extension.

-   Central extension

-   Fiber functor

-   Algebraic fundamental group

-   Certain groups that become isomorphic after field extensions have related automorphic representations.

-   Langlands dual: ${\mathcal{L}}(G)$ controls ${\mathsf{G}{\hbox{-}}\mathsf{Mod}}$ somehow, arises as an extension ${ \mathsf{Gal}} (k^s _{/ {k}} ) \to {\mathcal{L}}(G) \to H$ where $H \in \operatorname{Lie}{\mathsf{Grp}}_{/ {\mathbb{C}}} $.

-   A connected reductive algebraic group over a separably closed field $k$ is uniquely determined by its root datum.

-   Langlands dual: take root datum, dualize datum, take associated group.

-   Langlands' strategy for proving local and global conjectures: Arthur-Selberg trace formula.

-   Equivalence of orbital integrals can somehow be related to Springer fibers??

-   Starting point for Langlands: Artin reciprocity, generalizing quadratic reciprocity.

-   Chebotarev density theorem is a generalization of Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions.

-   "The Langlands conjectures associate an automorphic representation of the adelic group $\operatorname{GL}_n({\mathbb{A}}_{/ {\mathbb{Q}}} )$ to every $n{\hbox{-}}$dimensional irreducible representation of the Galois group, which is a cuspidal representation if the Galois representation is irreducible, such that the Artin $L$-function of the Galois representation is the same as the automorphic $L$-function of the automorphic representation"

-   Serre's modularity conjecture: an odd, irreducible, two-dimensional Galois representation over a finite field arises from a modular form. A stronger version of this conjecture specifies the weight and level of the modular form

-   ${\mathbb{A}}_{/ {\mathbb{Q}}} $: keeps track of all of the completions of ${\mathbb{Q}}$ simultaneously.

-   Reciprocity conjecture: a correspondence between automorphic representations of a reductive group and homomorphisms from a Langlands group to an $L$-group

-   Geometric Langlands: relates l-adic representations of the étale fundamental group of an algebraic curve to objects of the derived category of l-adic sheaves on the moduli stack of vector bundles over the curve.

-   2018: Lafforgue established global Langlands for automorphic forms to Galois reps for connected reductive groups over global function fields

-   "Purity": happens in a specific codimension

- Want to study homology cobordism groups of 3-manifolds $\Theta_\ZZ^3$.
  - We don't understand the torsion in this group.
  - Reduce to study of a group of "$\iota$ complexes".
  - Theorem: it has a $\ZZ^{\infty}$ summand.

- See [[Seifert fibered spaces]].

- People like HF because there are a lot of computation tools!
  In particular, a surgery formula.

Check out [[ideal sheaves]], [[Birdgeland stability conditions]].

- - "Rotate" an exact sequence to get an exact triangle:
  ![image_2021-05-18-22-20-05](_attachments/image_2021-05-18-22-20-05.png)

  - Interpretation of the triangle: $F = E \ominus \OO(-n) = E \oplus \OO(-n)[1]$.
  - Interpret $\OO(-n)[1] = -\OO(n)$.

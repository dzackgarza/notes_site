> Reference: Kristen Hendricks, *Surgery formulas for involutive Heegaard Floer homology*. Stanford Topology Seminar.

-   Want to study homology cobordism groups of 3-manifolds $\Theta_{\mathbb{Z}}^3$.

    -   We don't understand the torsion in this group.
    -   Reduce to study of a group of "$\iota$ complexes".
    -   Theorem: it has a ${\mathbb{Z}}^{\infty}$ summand.

-   See \[\[Seifert fibered spaces\]\].

-   People like HF because there are a lot of computation tools! In particular, a surgery formula.

Check out \[\[ideal sheaves\]\], \[\[Birdgeland stability conditions\]\].

-   -   "Rotate" an exact sequence to get an exact triangle: ![image_2021-05-18-22-20-05](_attachments/image_2021-05-18-22-20-05.png)

    -   Interpretation of the triangle: $F = E \ominus {\mathcal{O}}(-n) = E \oplus {\mathcal{O}}(-n)[1]$.

    -   Interpret ${\mathcal{O}}(-n)[1] = -{\mathcal{O}}(n)$.

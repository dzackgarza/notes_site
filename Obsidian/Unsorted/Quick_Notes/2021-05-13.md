Questions: $\pi_1(X)$ can be defined for schemes.

- What are the higher homotopy groups of schemes?
  - What do they measure? 
  - More fundamentally, what do higher homotopy groups of spheres measure about $\Top$ at all??
- What are the Eilenberg-MacLane spaces in $\Sch$?
- What are the Moore spaces in $\Sch$?
  - There should be an axiomatic characterization of these coming from [[model categories]].
- What are the "spheres" for $\Sch$? 
  - What are [[homotopy spheres]] in $\Sch$?
  - What are [[homology spheres]] in $\Sch$?

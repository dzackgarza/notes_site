Questions: $\pi_1(X)$ can be defined for schemes.

-   What are the higher homotopy groups of schemes?
    -   What do they measure?
    -   More fundamentally, what do higher homotopy groups of spheres measure about ${\mathsf{Top}}$ at all??
-   What are the Eilenberg-MacLane spaces in ${\mathsf{Sch}}$?
-   What are the Moore spaces in ${\mathsf{Sch}}$?
    -   There should be an axiomatic characterization of these coming from \[\[model categories\]\].
-   What are the "spheres" for ${\mathsf{Sch}}$?
    -   What are \[\[homotopy spheres\]\] in ${\mathsf{Sch}}$?
    -   What are \[\[homology spheres\]\] in ${\mathsf{Sch}}$?

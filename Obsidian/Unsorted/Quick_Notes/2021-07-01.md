## Motivation / Summary

Some notes on the Fargues-Fontaine curve $\Xff$, the fundamental curve of $p\dash$adic Hodge theory.

What's the point? 
There's supposed to be a "curve" $\Xff$ over $\QQpadic$ where local Langlands for $\QQpadic$ should be encoded as geometric Langlands on $\Xff$, which glues together important period rings from $p\dash$adic Hodge theory.
Stems from conjectures of Grothendieck wanting to related de Rham cohomology to Ã©tale cohomology, and a similar theorem proved by Faltings in the 80s.
Hot topic right now because of a conjecture related to local Langlands: supposed to give a way to go from the Galois side to the automorphic side. Important object: $\Bun_G$, the moduli stack of $G\dash$bundles for $G$ a reductive algebraic group over a local field over a family of $\Xff$ curves.

A useful overall analogy: it's like the Riemann sphere $\CP^1 \da \PP^1(\CC)$, and in fact the adic version is a $p\dash$adic Riemann surface.
The full ring of meromorphic functions on $\PP^1(\CC)$ is $\CC\qty{z}$, but $\CC[z]$ captures most of the data away from $\infty$.
$\CC[z]$ as a $\CC\dash$algebra consists of regular (polynomial) functions on $\PP^1(\CC)$ with a pole at $\infty$ of order equal to the degree of the polynomial. 
View the $\ZZ\dash$algebra $\ZZ$ as the regular functions on $P$ the set of primes (finite places), with a point at $\infty$ (infinite place) given by the usual valuation $\abs{\wait}$.
Make this more algebro-geometric by replacing $\ZZ$ with either $\ZZpadic$ or $\QQpadic$ (so $p\dash$adic things) and looking at $\QQpadic\dash$algebras $B$ as replacements for regular functions.
$\Xff$ is also supposed to "geometrize" period rings from $p\dash$adic Hodge theory.
One can also geometrize class field theory somehow, and realize $\Gal(\bar\QQ/\QQ)$ as some kind of fundamental group.

$\Xff$ is also roughly a moduli of "untilts", which allow passing between $\FF_p$ and $\QQpadic$.
A major goal is to go from characteristic zero to characteristic $p$ (relatively easy) and then to go back to characteristic zero (relatively hard).
The curve is useful because many linear algebraic objects of $p\dash$adic theory can be translated into vector bundles over $\Xff$, and there is "Grothendieck splitting" type of theorem for those.


*Todos*: motivate

- Perfectoid spaces
- Tilts/untilts
- Galois representations (might have notes elsewhere..?)
- Langlands, period!
- Absolute Galois groups, particularly $G(\Qbar/\QQ)$ (see notes elsewhere)
- Relations to homotopy theory: an isomorphism of Lubin-Tate, and the Drinfeld tower?

### Definitions

- *Curve*: over $k=\kbar$, an integral separated scheme of finite type over $k$ of dimension 1.
- *Finite type*: on affines, when $\spec A\to \spec B$ induces $B\to A$ making $A \in \modsleft{B}$ finitely generated.
- *Algebraic curve*: $X$ of pure Krull dimension 1, or equivalently $X$ has an affine open cover $\ts{\spec R_i}_{i\in I} \covers X$ where each $\spec R_i$ is Krull dimension 1.
  - For (irreducible) varieties over $k=\kbar$, just an algebraic variety of dimension 1.
- *Complete curve*: for algebraic varieties $X$, universally closed: the projections $X\cross (\wait)\to(\wait)$ are closed maps when evaluated on any variety.

  Equivalently, $X\to k$ is a proper morphism (separated, finite type, and universally closed)
  - For topological spaces, $X$ is compact iff $X$ is complete.
  - Complete (smooth) varieties of dimension 1 are always projective.
- *Completely valued field*: a field $k$ equipped with a valuation $v$, where $k$ is complete as a metric space with respect to $v$.
- *Valuation*: a group morphism $(K, \cdot) \to (\RR_{\geq 0}, +)$ with $v(a) = \infty \iff a =0$ satisfying an ultrametric triangle inequality.
  - Almost a metric. Supposed to capture the multiplicity of zeros/poles of a function.
- *Valuation ring*: defined as $\OO_K \da \ts{x\in K \st v(x) \leq 1}$, the unit disc with respect to the valuation.
  - Has a unique maximal ideal, the interior of the disc: $\mfm \da \OO_K\sm \ts{v(x) = 1}$.
- *Dedekind scheme*: a Noetherian integral scheme of dimension 1 where every local ring is regular.
  - Example: $\spec R$ for $R$ a Dedekind domain.
  - Slogan: any non-generic point is a closed point.
- *Tilts*: for $k$ a field, denoted 
\[
k^\tilt \da \inverselim (k\mapsvia{x\mapsto x^p} k \mapsvia{x\mapsto x^p} k \cdots)
,\]
realized as certain sequences $\ts{x_n}$ where $x_{n+1}^p = x_n$, made into a characteristic $p$ field with pointwise multiplication and a $p\dash$twisted addition law involving limits.
  - Idea: an inverse limit of applying Frobenius.
  Yields a perfect $\FF_p\dash$algebra.
  Equipped with a valuation and a valuation ring.
- *Untilts*: For $k$ a field, a pair $(K, \iota)$ where $\iota: k\mapsvia{\sim} K^\tilt$ is an isomorphism of fields, plus a condition on valuation rings $\OO_k$ and $\OO_K^\tilt$.
- *Formal schemes*: topologically ringed spaces $(X, \OO_X)$ where $\OO_X$ is a sheaf of topological rings, which is locally a formal spectrum of a Noetherian ring.
- *Formal spectrum*: $\Spf R \da \Spf_I R = \colim_{n} \Spec R/I^n$, where $I^n$ is a system of ideals forming neighborhoods of zero in the sense that if $U\ni 0$ then $I^n \subseteq U$ for some $n$. 
    Take the colimit in $\Top\Ringedspace$.
    The structure sheaf of $\Spf_I R$ is $\colim_{n} \OO_{\spec R/I^n}$
  - Meant to accommodate formal power series as regular functions.
  - Examples: $I\normal R$, take the $I\dash$adic topology with basic open sets $r + I^n$.
    Then $\realize{\Spf A} = \realize{\Spec A/I}$, so the underlying point-set spaces are the same.
- *Formal disk*: an infinitesimal thickening of a point.
- *Punctured formal disk*: remove the unique global point from a formal disk.
- *adic space*: for $X$ a variety over a nonarchimedean field, e.g. $\QQpadic$, the associated analytic space $X^\an$.
- *Periods*: the results of integrating an algebraic differential form in $H_\dR^*$ over a cycle in singular cohomology $H_{\sing}^*$.
  Just a number in $\CC$!

- *Witt vectors*: complicated construction, similar to $p\dash$adic integers.
  Uniquely characterized as a lift $W(K)$ of a perfect $\FF_p\dash$algebra $K$ to $\ZZpadic\dash$algebra, which becomes $p\dash$adically complete and $p\dash$torsionfree.
  Also lifts Frobenius.
- *Perfectoid spaces*: ? Frobenius is an isomorphism? Plus other conditions?
  - For rings, there is a natural map in $p\dash$adic Hodge theory $\AA_\inf(S) \to S$, and if $S$ is perfectoid this is supposed to look like a 1-parameter deformation ("pro-infinitesimal").
  - If $\char S = p$, then $S$ is perfectoid iff $S$ is perfect, i.e. Frobenius is an automorphism.
  - If $K$ is a perfectoid field, then $G(\bar K/K) \cong G(\bar{K^\tilt}/K^\tilt)$, so we can study absolute Galois groups here (result of "almost purity" theorems).

- *Mixed characteristic*: a ring $R$ with an ideal $I\normal R$ with $\char R = 0$ but $\char R/I = p > 0$.
  The motivating examples: $\ZZ$, or $\OO_K$ for $K$ a number field, $\ZZpadic$.


### Main Results


- Why care about tilts/untilts: for $k$ a field and $X\da \spec \QQ$ as a scheme, characteristic zero tilts of $k$ are a good replacement for $X(k)$ which makes $X\cross X$ nontrivial.

- Main theorem: if $k = \kbar$ is a completely valued characteristic $p$ field, then there exists a Dedekind scheme $X \to \spec \QQpadic$ whose closed points $x$ correspond to (isomorphism classes) of characteristic 0 untilts of $k$, modulo the action of the Frobenius $\varphi(x) = x^p$.
  - So moduli of untilts of a perfectoid field, behaves like open disc in $\CC$.
  The unique characteristic $p$ untilt is like $z=0 \in \CC$.

- Why the FF "curve" isn't a curve: it's a scheme over $\QQpadic$, but not finite-type: specifically, the structure morphism $X\to \spec \QQpadic$ is not finite type.

  - Why not finite type? Since if $x\in X$ is a closed point then the residue field $\kappa(x) / \QQpadic$ is not a finite extension.
  - Incidentally, $\kappa(x)$ is exactly the untilt of $k$ corresponding to $x$.

- Nice properties of $\Xff$ coinciding with curves:
  - $\sum \deg_f(x) = 0$ for every rational function $f$ on $\Xff$, similar to being projective/complete as a scheme/variety.
    - Note: very similar to a theorem from complex analysis: sum of orders of poles and zeros equals zero for a meromorphic function on $\PP^1(\CC)$.
  - Line bundles are classified by degree
  - $H^1(C, \OO_C) = 0$, similar to having genus $g=0$.
    - Usually it's like $2g = \rank H^1$
  - The structure morphism $X\to \spec \QQpadic$ has simply connected fibers



- Useful heuristics:

## Constructing the curve

Notation: 

- $B_\eps \da B^{\varphi = 1}_\crys$
- $\AA_\inf(K) \da W(K^\tilt)$, i.e. just Witt vectors of the tilt.
  - Supposed to interpolate between the $\char 0$ geometry of $K$ and $\char p$ geometry of $K^\tilt$.
  - Importantly, even if $K$ doesn't have  Frobenius, $K^\tilt$ does!
    This will yield an action of Frobenius on cohomology -- this is probably used to set up trace formulas.


### Method 1: Schematically, Proj Construction

- Punchline: $\Xff = \Proj\qty{\bigoplus_{n\geq 0} B^{\varphi = p^n}}$ as a scheme.

- $B^{\varphi = p^n}$ are the elements in $B$ where $\varphi(x) = p^n x$ where $\varphi$ is the Frobenius.
- $B \da \colim_{I\subseteq [0, 1] \subset \RR} B_{I}$ is a $p\dash$adic Frechet space
  - Supposed to look like holomorphic functions of $p$.

- For $I\da [a, b]$, $B_{[a, b]}$ is the completion of $W(\OO_C^\tilt)\adjoin{{1\over p}, {1\over \abs \pi }}$ with respect to Gauss norms, where $W$ denotes the Witt vectors, and we've localized at $p$ and $\pi$ a pseudo-uniformizer.

- Other notation used:

- Alternatively using the Riemann sphere analogy: $\PP^1(\CC)$ can be recovered as a proj.
  Write $\Fil_k \CC[z] \da \ts{f\in \CC[z] \st \deg f \leq k}$ to be the $k$th filtered piece using a filtration by degree.

- The claim is that $\PP_1(\CC) \cong \Proj\qty{\bigoplus_{k\geq 0} \Fil_k \CC[z]}$.
  - Somehow this uses that $\CC[z_0, z_1] \mapsvia{\sim} \bigoplus_{k\geq 0} \Fil_k \CC[z]$, no clue..
- By analogy, maybe $\Xff = \Proj\qty{ \bigoplus_{k\geq 0} \Fil_k B_\eps}$ where $\Fil_k B_\eps \da \ts{b\in B_\eps \st v(b) \geq k}$, where we take a valuation $v$ coming from $B_\dR$.
- There is a subalgebra $B_\crys^+ \subseteq B_\crys$ where $B_\crys^+\invert{t} \cong B_{\crys}$ for some $t$, plus some other properties.
- Can then obtain
\[
\Xff = \Proj\qty{\bigoplus _{k\geq 0} \qty{B_\crys^+}^{\varphi = p^k}}
.\]


#### Informal Description

Glue together *period rings*: an affine scheme to a formal disk along a formal punctured disc, so like
\[
\Xff = \spec B_{\crys}^{\varphi = 1} \glue{\spec B_{\dR }} \spec B_{\dR}^+
.\]

- $\spec B_{\crys}^{\varphi = 1}$ is an affine scheme.
- $\spec B_{\dR^+}$ is a formal disk.
- $\spec B_{\dR}$ is a formal punctured disk.

- $B_\dR$ is a *period ring*, cooked up to relate $H^*_\dR(Y)$ to $H^*_{\et}(Y_{\bar K}; \QQpadic)$ when $Y$ is the generic fiber of a scheme over $W(k)$ and $Y_{\bar K} \da Y \fiberprod{\spec K} \spec \bar K$ (see *Crystalline comparison conjecture*).
  - $B_{\dR}$ is a complete DVR, a field, and a (very large) $\QQpadic\dash$algebra with residue characteristic zero, and $B_{\crys} \leq B_{\dR}$ is a subring.
- $B_\dR^+$ is its valuation ring (or place), i.e. a subring such that for every element $x$ of $\ff(B_{\dR})$, either $x \in B_{\dR}^+$ or $x\inv \in B_{\dR}^+$.
  - This is supposed to be like a ring of integers $\OO_K$ for a number field $K$.
  It is non-canonically isomorphic to the $p\dash$adic Laurent field $\CC_p((t))$.
- So it's like the one-point compactification of $\spec$ of the period ring of $p\dash$adic Hodge theory.


- This is supposed to look like building the Riemann sphere $\PP^1(\CC)$ as $\CC[z]$ (regular away from $\infty)$ glued to $\CC\dqty{1\over z}$ (germs of meromorphic functions at $\infty$).
  - $B_{\crys}^{\varphi = 1}$ is supposed to look like $\CC[z]$.
  Classically, $\CC\qty{z}$ is the full field of meromorphic functions on $\CP^1$, and $\CC\adjoin{z}$ are regular functions on $\CP^1\sm\ts{\infty}$.
  - And $B_\dR$ is like $\CC\dqty{1\over z}$, germs of meromorphic functions at infinity.
  - Taking $\CP^1$ and puncturing at a point yields a disc, so $\CP^1\sm\ts{\infty}, \CP^1\sm\ts{0}$ are discs.
    Their overlap is $\CP^1\sm\ts{\infty, 0} \cong \DD\sm\ts{0}$, a disc punctured at $z=0$.

## Other Random Notes


- Much like $\PP^1(\CC)$, we have a Grothendieck splitting principle: every vector bundle $\mce \to \Xff$ splits uniquely as $\mce \cong \bigoplus_{k=1}^m \OO_{\Xff}(\lambda _k)$ where $\lambda_k \in \QQ$ are weakly decreasing and $\OO_{\Xff}(\lambda)$ is a (somewhat complicated) rational twist.
  - Proof uses $p\dash$divisible groups, can be used to answer questions in $p\dash$adic Hodge theory (e.g. about Galois representations).
- Needs Scholze's theory of diamonds: Weil's proof of RH for curves uses the surface $X\fiberprod{\FF_q} X$ for $X$ a curve (this surface is also used in shtuka theory in geometric Langlands), need a similar object in arithmetic geometry that should morally look like $\ZZ \tensor_{\FF_1} \ZZ$.


- $H^1(\Xff; \OO_{\Xff}) = \QQpadic$, which can apparently be computed using Äech cohomology and the fundamental exact sequence:
\[
0 \longrightarrow \mathbb{Q}_{p} \longrightarrow B_{e} \longrightarrow B_{\mathrm{dR}} / B_{\mathrm{dR}}^{+} \longrightarrow 0
.\]

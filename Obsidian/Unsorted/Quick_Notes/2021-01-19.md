- What is [../canonical%20bundle.md](../canonical%20bundle.md)?
- What is the [../tautological%20bundle.md](../tautological%20bundle.md)?
 	 Is this the *same* as the canonical bundle?
- How does one define $\OO(1)$? [../O(D)%20for%20D%20a%20divisor.md](../O(D)%20for%20D%20a%20divisor.md)
- Tensoring differential forms: $\omega^{\tensor k}$.
  What algebraic things does this live in? How do you write it in local coordinates?

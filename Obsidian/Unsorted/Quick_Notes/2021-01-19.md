-   What is [[../canonical%20bundle.md | ../canonical%20bundle.html]]?
-   What is the [[../tautological%20bundle.md | ../tautological%20bundle.html]]? Is this the *same* as the canonical bundle?
-   How does one define ${\mathcal{O}}(1)$? [[../O(D)%20for%20D%20a%20divisor.md | ../O(D)%20for%20D%20a%20divisor.html]]
-   Tensoring differential forms: $\omega^{\otimes k}$. What algebraic things does this live in? How do you write it in local coordinates?

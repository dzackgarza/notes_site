## Hopf Invariant One

Cool fact: you can show the non-existence of [../Hopf%20invariant%20one.md](../Hopf%20invariant%20one.md) elements in dimensions $1,2,4,8$ using K theory. 
The argument is pretty clean, and the paper is only 8 pages: <https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/adamatiy.pdf>

See Mosh-Tang for the original proof using cohomology operations: <https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/moshtang.pdf>.
This also apparently includes computations of cohomology of EM spaces.

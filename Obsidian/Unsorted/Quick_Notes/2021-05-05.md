- There is apparently a theory of [algebraic%20cobordism](algebraic%20cobordism).

- If $r$ is the rank and $g$ is the genus for $X$ a nice curve over $\QQ$ with good reduction at $p$, 
  - Want to find rational points
  - If $r<g$ (?) then [Chabauty-Coleman](Chabauty-Coleman) applies.
  - This talk: $r=g$, allows finding a basis for $\QQ_p$ valued functions on $J(\QQ)$.
- See p-adic [height%20pairing](height%20pairing).
  - Height pairing has to do with rational points on [../Jacobian.md](../Jacobian.md)?
  - Trying to compute [canonical%20heights](canonical%20heights)?
  - See [local%20height](local%20height)
  - See [Weil%20height%20machine](Weil%20height%20machine)
- Can compute heights as intersection numbers on regular models.
- See [Abel-Jacobi%20map](Abel-Jacobi%20map)
- Try to realize rational points as the zero locus of p-adic analytic functions.
- Recent work: quadratic Chabauty used to find all rational points on the infamously cursed [../modular%20curve.md) $X_S(13](../modular%20curve.md)%20$X_S(13)$.
- Looking for explanations through [p-adic%20Hodge%20theory](../p-adic%20Hodge%20theory.md).
- See [../Mordell-Weil%20rank.md](../Mordell-Weil%20rank.md)
- See [Néron-Severi](Néron-Severi) of the Jacobian
- Get height functions where local heights $h_p$ can be computed by iterated [Coleman%20integrals](Coleman%20integrals).
- There is a canonical height machine for abelian varieties.
  - Need a curvature form in \( \Omega^1(X) \tensor H^1_\dR(X) \).
  - Get one height for each choice of [idele%20class%20character](idele%20class%20character)
- *Symmetric line bundles*: \( \mathcal{L}\cong [1]^* \mathcal{L} \).

- Zhang defines a **metric** on a [../line%20bundle.md](../line%20bundle.md): gives a way to measure the size of elements in each fiber.
  - It's a locally bounded continuous function $\nu: \mathcal{L}\units \da  \Tot( \mathcal{L} ) \smz \to \RR$ with $\nu( \alpha \vector v) = v_p(\alpha) + \nu(\vector v)$ for \( \alpha\in \bar{\QQ_p}\units, \vector v \in \mathcal{L}\units   \).
  - Here continuous is in the locally analytic topology, since we're over $\QQ_p$.
  - Can do all of the usual stuff carrying the additional data of the metric: tensor powers, pullbacks, etc.

- When you have an integral model: take closures!
  - Picking integral models allows measuring sizes of sections.

- See [valuations](valuations), used to define *admissible metrics*.
- Admissible metrics on $\OO_X$ factor through the [reduction%20graph](reduction%20graph)
  - See [semistable%20model](semistable%20model) of a curve $X_{/\QQp}$.

- Adelic metric: a collection of metrics for almost every [../place.md](../place.md).
  - Associated height function: for $x\in X(\QQ)$, pick a section not vanishing at $x$ and sum all contributions: $x\mapsto \sum_{p \in \Places} v_p (s(x))$.

- Rigidified bundles: remember a point in the fiber.

- For each place, there is a canonical metric which makes certain isomorphisms isometries in a Banach space
  - Apply Banach fixed-point theorem to the self-map $A \mapsvia{[2]} A$.

- Curvature form $\Curv(\mathcal{L}_v)$ is sent to the first [../Chern%20class.md) $c_1(\mathcal{L}_v](../Chern%20class.md)%20$c_1(/mathcal{L}_v)$ under cup product in de Rham cohomology.

- To get a canonical metric for all line bundles, it suffices to canonically metrize the [../Poincare%20bundle.md](../Poincare%20bundle.md).
  Every line bundle on $A$ is a pullback of it.

- Any two metrics with the same curvature differ by $\int \omega$ for $\omega$

  - $K^\alg(\SS)$ is of interest due to Waldhausen's stable parameterized [../h-cobordism%20theorem.md](../h-cobordism%20theorem.md).
    - How to understand it: look at [Galois%20descent) on $K(\ZZ](Galois%20descent)%20on%20$K(/ZZ)$
- A first approximation: $K^\alg(L_{K(n)} \SS)$, so localize with respect to [../Morava%20K-theory.md](../Morava%20K-theory.md)
- Rognes extends [Lichtenbaum-Quillen%20conjectures](../Lichtenbaum-Quillen%20conjectures.md) and develops a theory for Galois extensions of $\SS\dash$algebras
- [chromatic%20complexity](chromatic%20complexity) by one.

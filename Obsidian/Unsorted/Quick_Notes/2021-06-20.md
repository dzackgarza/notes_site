  - $K^\alg(\SS)$ is of interest due to Waldhausen's stable parameterized [[Unsorted/h-cobordism theorem]].
    - How to understand it: look at [[Galois descent]] on $K(/ZZ)$
- A first approximation: $K^\alg(L_{K(n)} \SS)$, so localize with respect to [[Unsorted/Morava K-theory]]
- Rognes extends [[../Lichtenbaum-Quillen conjectures]] and develops a theory for Galois extensions of $\SS\dash$algebras
- Increases [[chromatic complexity]] by one.

- Some big conjectures in AG/NT:
  - The [Ash%20Conjecture](../Ash%20Conjecture.md):
    [symmetric%20spaces](symmetric%20spaces).
  - Deligne's [weight%20monodromy%20conjecture](../weight%20monodromy%20conjecture.md):
    Something to do with [complete%20intersections](complete%20intersections).
- What's the deal with [Prismatic%20cohomology](../Prismatic%20cohomology.md)?
  - Something coming from Bhatt: an integral version of [p-adic%20Hodge%20theory](../p-adic%20Hodge%20theory.md) which is supposed to link a bunch of other cohomology theories.

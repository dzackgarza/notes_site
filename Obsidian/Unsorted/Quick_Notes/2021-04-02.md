-   Some big conjectures in AG/NT:
    -   The [[Ash%20Conjecture | ../Ash%20Conjecture.html]]: [symmetric%20spaces](symmetric%20spaces).
    -   Deligne's [[weight%20monodromy%20conjecture | ../weight%20monodromy%20conjecture.html]]: Something to do with [complete%20intersections](complete%20intersections).
-   What's the deal with [[Prismatic%20cohomology | ../Prismatic%20cohomology.html]]?
    -   Something coming from Bhatt: an integral version of [[p-adic%20Hodge%20theory | ../p-adic%20Hodge%20theory.html]] which is supposed to link a bunch of other cohomology theories.

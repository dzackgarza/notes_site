Bhargav Bhatt (Harvard NT Seminar)

- One can take [etale%20cohomology](../etale%20cohomology.md) of varieties, and later refine to schemes, and thus take it for the base field even when it's not algebraically closed and extract arithmetically interesting information.

- [Prismatic%20cohomology](../Prismatic%20cohomology.md): meant to relate a number of other cohomology theories

- [Prism): a pair $(A, I](Prism):%20a%20pair%20$(A,%20I)$ where $A$ is a commutative ring with a derived Frobenius lift $\phi:A\to A$, i.e. a $\delta\dash$structure.
  - $I \normal A$ is an ideal defining a [Cartier%20divisor](../Cartier%20divisor.md).
  - $A$ is $(P, I)\dash$complete.
  - Any ideal generator $d\in I$ satisfies $\phi(d) = d^p + p\cdot u, u\in A\units$.

- Fix a scheme and study prisms over it.
  Need these definitions to have stability under base-change.

- Examples:
  - $A \da \ZZ_p$ and $\phi = \id$ with $I = \gens{ p }$ yields [Crystalline%20cohomology](Crystalline%20cohomology). 
  - $A \da \ZZ_p\fps{u}, \phi(u) = u^p$.
  Then $I = \gens{ E(u) }$ is generated by an [Eisenstein%20polynomial](Eisenstein%20polynomial). 
  Here $A/I = \OO_K$

- Prismatic [Formal%20scheme](Formal%20scheme) over $A/I$.
  Define
  \[
  (X/A)_\prism = \ts{ (A, I) \to (B, J) \in \Mor(\Prism), \Spf(B/J) \to X \text{ over } A/I } 
  ,\]
  topologized via the [flat%20topology](flat%20topology) on $B/J$.

- There is a [../structure%20sheaf.md) $\OO_\prism$ where $(B, J](../structure%20sheaf.md)%20$/OO_/prism$%20where%20$(B,%20J) \to B$.
  Take $\Rd \Gamma$, which receives a Frobenius action, to define a cohomology theory.
  Why is this a good idea?

- Absolute prismatic sites: for $X\in \Sch(\padic)$, define
\[
X_\prism \da \ts{ (B, J) \in \Prism,\, \Spf(B/J) \to X } 
.\]
  Take [[sheaf%20cohomology) to obtain $\Rd\Gamma_\prism(X) \da \Rd \Gamma(X_\prism, \OO_\prism]] \selfmap_\phi$.

- The category $\Prism$ doesn't have a [final%20object](final%20object), so has interesting cohomology.
Relates to algebraic $K\dash$theory of $\ZZ_p$?

- Questions: let $X_{/\ZZ_p}$ be a smooth formal scheme.
  -  What is the [cohomological%20dimension) of $\Rd \Gamma_\prism(X](cohomological%20dimension)%20of%20$/Rd%20/Gamma_/prism(X)$?
  - What are the $F\dash$[crystals](crystals) on $X_\prism$?
    - Produce finite flat $B\dash$modules?

- Bhatt and Lurie: found a stacky way to understand the absolute prismatic site of $\ZZ_p$.
  Drinfeld found independently.

- Construction due to Simpson: take $X\in \Var(\Alg)$, define a de Rham presheaf
\[
X_{\dR}: \CCalg^{\fp} &\to \Set \\
R &\mapsto X(R_\red)
.\]

  - Translates other cohomology theories into something about coherent sheaves..?
  - Can reduce to studying e.g. a vector bundle on a more complicated object.

- Def: Cartier-Witt stack, a.k.a. the prismatization of $\ZZ_p$
   - Define $\WCart$ to be the [formal%20stack](formal%20stack) on $p\dash$complete rings.
- Plug in a $p\dash$nilpotent ring $R$ to extract all (derived) prism structure on $W(R)$.
- Prisms aren't base-change compatible without the derived part.
- This is a [../groupoid.md](../groupoid.md).

- An explicit presentation: $\WCart_0(R)$ are distinguished [../Witt%20Vectors.md) in $W(R](../Witt%20Vectors.md)%20in%20$W(R)$.
  Given by \( [a_0, a_1, \cdots ] \) where $a_0$ is nilpotent and $a_1$ is a unit.
  This is a formal affine scheme.
  $\WCart = \WCart_0 / W^*$ is a presentation as a [stack%20quotient](stack%20quotient).

  - Receives a natural Frobenius action, which is a [derived%20Frobenius%20lift](derived%20Frobenius%20lift).

- Start by understanding its points, suffices to evaluate on fields of characteristic $p$.

- If $k\in \Field(\Perf)_{\chp}$, $\WCart(k) = \ts{ \pt }$, with the point represented by $(W(k), ?)$.

  - Yields a (geometric?) point $x_{\FFp}: \spec(\FFp) \to \WCart$.

- Analogy to understanding [../Hodge-Tate%20cohomology.md](../Hodge-Tate%20cohomology.md).
  Similar easy locus in this stack.

- Take 0th component of distinguished [../Witt%20Vectors.md](../Witt%20Vectors.md) to get a diagram

- The bottom-left is this [Hodge-Tate%20stack](Hodge-Tate%20stack).

- Now has a better chance of being an [formal%20stack](formal%20stack).
  Bottom arrow kills the formal direction.

- Will be [../group%20scheme.md](../group%20scheme.md): need to produce a point and take automorphisms.

- Take the distinguished element $V(?) \in W(\ZZ_p)$.
Produces a map
\[
\Spf(\ZZ_p) \mapsvia{\pi_\HT} \WCart^\HT
.\]

  - Fact: $\pi_\HT$ is a flat cover and $\Aut(\pi_\HT) = W^*[ F]$.

- **Upshot**: $\WCart^\HT = \B W^* [F]$ is a classifying stack.
  [quasicoherent%20sheaves) on the left and representations of the (classifying stack of the) group scheme on the right. I.e. $\D_\qc(\WCart^\HT) = \Rd (W^*[F](quasicoherent%20sheaves)%20on%20the%20left%20and%20representations%20of%20the%20(classifying%20stack%20of%20the)%20group%20scheme%20on%20the%20right.%20I.e.%20$/D_/qc(/WCart^/HT)%20=%20/Rd%20(W^*[F)]$.
  - Teichmüller lift yields a $\ZZ/p$ grading on the LHS.

  - Something about Deligne-Illusie?
  	[Hodge-to-deRham%20degeneration](Hodge-to-deRham%20degeneration)
  - Upshot: a [../divisor.md](../divisor.md) inside is easy to understand.

- Fact: $\D_\qc(\WCart)$ are equivalent to 
\[
\inverselim_{(A, I)\in \Prism} \D_{(P, I)-?}(A)
.\]

- Diffracted Hodge cohomology: let $X\in \Schf_{\ZZ_p}$.
  Get a prismatic structure sheaf using the assignment $(A, I) \to \Rd \Gamma_\prism \qty{ (X\tensor A/I) / A}$.

- Heuristic: $\spec \ZZ_p$ should be 1-dimensional over something.

- Get an absolute comparison: $\cohdim \Rd \Gamma_\prism (X) \leq d+1$ where $d = \reldim X_{/\ZZ_p}$.

- There is a deRham comparison: 
\[
X_{\FFp}^* H_\prism(X) \cong \Rd \Gamma_\dR (X_{\FFp})
.\]

- There is a Hodge-Tate comparison: the object $H_\prism(X)$ restricted to $\WCart^\HT$ has an increasing filtration with $\gr_i = \Rd \Gamma(X, \Omega^i_X)[-i]$.

  - Use representation interpretation, then $\mu_p \actson \gr_i$ by weight $-i$.

- Combine these comparisons to get Deligne-Illusie: if $\reldim X < p$, then 
\[
\Rd \Gamma_\dR(X_{\FFp}) \cong \bigoplus_{i} \Rd \Gamma(X_{\FFp}, \Omega^i[-i])
.\]
Get a lift to characteristic zero, yields Hodge-to-deRham degeneration there.

- An $F\dash$crystal on $X_\prism$ is a vector bundle $\bundle{E} \in \Vect(X_\prism, \OO_\prism)$? 
  Plus some extra data.

- Infinite tensor product:
\[
I_\prism \tensor F^* I_\prism \tensor (F^2)^* I_\prism \tensor \cdots 
.\]
  Converges to some object \( \OO_\prism \ts{ 1 } \in \Pic(X_\prism, \OO_\prism ) \), twisted?
  Yields isomorphism of sheaves after inverting $I_\prism$,
   \[
   F^* \OO_\prism \ts{ 1 } \cong I_\prism\inv \tensor \OO_\prism \ts{ 1 } 
   .\]

   - Convergence: this is a formal stack, any [thickening](thickening) are identified with something...
   On each finite approximation, most terms are $\OO_X$.

- Some analog of [Artin–Schreier](Artin–Schreier) here, taking fixed points?

- There is a natural functor from $F\dash$crystals on $X$ to local $\ZZ_p$ systems on a geometric fiber $X_?$?

- Main theorem: produces [../descent.md) data, uses work on Beilinson fiber sequence (Benjamin Antieau, Morrow, others?](../descent.md)%20data,%20uses%20work%20on%20Beilinson%20fiber%20sequence%20(Benjamin%20Antieau,%20Morrow,%20others?)

- Can say
\[
H^i(\Delta_{\ZZ_p}) =
\begin{cases}
\ZZ_p & i=0 
\\
\prod_{\NN} \ZZ_p & i=1.
\end{cases}
\]
  Can compute using [../topological%20Hochschild%20homology.md](../topological%20Hochschild%20homology.md)?
  $\pi_{-1}( \TP(\ZZ_p) )$ is where the $i=1$ part comes from.

  - [../Hodge-Tate%20cohomology.md](../Hodge-Tate%20cohomology.md).

- Prismatic is filtered by things that look like Hodge-Tate

- Absolute = arithmetic (take eigenspaces, related to [motivic%20cohomology)](motivic%20cohomology)), relative = geometric?

  - Link to [../K-Theory.md](../K-Theory.md) comes from eigenspaces somehow.

- Similar to situation in [../Étale%20cohomology.md](../etale%20cohomology.md): need absolute and relative to compute either.

## Why are [../derived%20category.md](../derived%20category.md) important?

- Homological algebra lives in the [../derived%20category.md](../derived%20category.md)
- In AG, tight link between [coherent%20sheaves](coherent%20sheaves)
- See the [Bondal-Orlov%20conjecture](../Bondal-Orlov%20conjecture.md).
  - [../birational.md](../birational.md) is a weakening of isomorphism between varieties
  - Being derived equivalent is a weakening of having equivalent $\DCoh$
  - Both recover actual isomorphisms in the case of smooth projective varieties
- Rep theory: equivalent derived categories is called [Morita%20equivalence](Morita%20equivalence).
  - Derived equivalence is a weakening of Morita equivalence
  - Can replace an algebra by a much simpler derived-equivalent one
  - Use to study [group%20algebra](../group%20algebra.md)
  - Lots of numerical consequences?

### The Relationship Between [../K-Theory.md](../K-Theory.md)

> Some remarks on $\THoH$ and $K\dash$Theory, no clue what the original source was:

- [../topological%20Hochschild%20homology.md](../topological%20Hochschild%20homology.md) somehow makes computations easier.
- \(K\dash\)theory says something about [monodromy](monodromy) of vector bundles around infinitesimal loops
- For $X$ a nice [derived%20stacks)  $\Map_\DSt(S^1, X](derived%20stacks)%20%20$/Map_/DSt(S^1,%20X)$.
  - Points of $LX$: infinitesimal loops in $X$
- Identify $\THoH(X) \mapsvia{\sim} \OO(LX)$ (global functions)
  - Corollary of a result in Ben-Zvi--Francis--Nadler "Integral Transforms and Drinfeld Centers in [../derived%20algebraic%20geometry.md](../derived%20algebraic%20geometry.md)"?
- [Dennis%20trace): a comparison $K(X) \to \THoH(X](Dennis%20trace):%20a%20comparison%20$K(X)%20/to%20/THoH(X)$, takes $E\in \VectBundle$ to the canonical monodromy automorphism of the pullback of $E$ to $LX$
  - Use the map $LX\to X$ sending a loop to its basepoint
- Traces are $S^1\dash$[../equivariant.md](../equivariant.md) because loops!
  	Just equip $K(X)$ with the trivial $S^1$ action.

- Take [Homotopy%20fixed%20points](Homotopy%20fixed%20points) to get something smaller than $\THoH$: $\THC^-$, topological negative cyclic homology
  - See Connes' negative [cyclic%20homology](cyclic%20homology)

- Dennis trace is invariant under *all* covering maps of circles, even multisheeted
  - Encoded not in a group action by a [cyclotomic%20structure](cyclotomic%20structure).
  - Take homotopy fixed points of the cyclotomic structure on $\THoH$ to get $\TC$, [../Topological%20cyclic%20homology.md](../Topological%20cyclic%20homology.md)
  - There is a map $K\to \TC$
- Theorem of Dundas-Goodwillie-McCarthy: whenever $A\to A'$ is a nilpotent extension of connective [Ring%20Spectra), $K(A') \mapsvia{\sim} K(A) \fiberprod{\TC(A)} \TC(A'](../Ring%20Spectra.md),%20$K(A')%20/mapsvia{/sim}%20K(A)%20/fiberprod{/TC(A)}%20/TC(A')$

## Time Management

- Setting goals: SMART.
  Doesn't work for research though!

- I really like the "keeping a problem list" idea.

- Don't be ashamed to ask people if they have problems you can work on.

- Thinking about the link between group cohomology and homotopy theory: if I have a SES 
\[
0\to A \to B \to C \to 0
,\]
  should one apply a functor like $K(\wait, 1)$?
  Is this actually a functor...?
  We definitely get spaces $K(A, 1)$ and $K(B, 1)$, for example, and there must be an induced map between them.
  Want to make precise what it means to get a SES like this:
  \[
  0 \to K(A, 1) \to K(B, 1) \to K(C, 1) \to 0
  .\]
  One would kind of want this to be part of a [fiber%20sequence](fiber%20sequence) I guess.
  But we're in $\Top$ anyway, so there's no real issue with just doing [../fibrant%20and%20cofibrant%20objects.md](../fibrant%20and%20cofibrant%20objects.md),.

  Maybe the "right" think to do here is to actually take a classifying [../groupoid.md) (?](../groupoid.md)%20(?), which must be some functor like $\B: \Grp \to \Grpd$.
  Surely this is some known thing.
  But then what is an "exact sequence of groupoids"...?
  \[
  0 \to \B A \to \B B \to \B C \to 0
  .\]

  Also, why should such a functor be an exact? 
  It'd kind of be more interesting if it *weren't*.
  Say it's right-exact, then how might you make sense of $\Ld \B(\wait)$?
  I think this just needs a model category structure on the *source*, although it seems reasonable to expect that $\Grpd$ would have some simple model structure.


## SeZoom

[../l-adic%20representations.md](../l-adic%20representations.md)

- Try computing things like $\Gal (\QQ( \zeta_3, \sqrt{3})$.

- There's some way to check orders of Galois groups using [../valuation.md](../valuation.md)..?

- See Néron-Ogg-Shafarevich criterion: [unipotently](unipotently).

- Always have quasi-unipotently, so eigenvalues roots of unity.
	- Easy for [../elliptic%20curve.md](../elliptic%20curve.md). 
	- For [Néron%20models](Néron%20models), see Silverman.

- [Galois%20representations](../Galois%20representations.md) at different primes are related, using local info at a few primes to get global info at all primes.

- $\inftycat{\infty, 2}$: discrete set of objects, enriched in categories, $2\dash$morphisms are strictly associative?
- $\inftycat{\infty, n}$: all $n+k\dash$morphisms are invertible.
- There is an embedding $n\Cat$ into $(\infty, n)\dash\Cat$with a specific model structure.
- Model structure on $\sSet$: fibrant objects are Kan complexes, there is a Quillen equivalence between $\Top$ and $\sSet$
- $\inftycat{\infty, 1}$: enriched in $\inftygpd$
  - Quasicategory: lifting property with lifting against inner horns online

  - Joyal model structure: $\sSet$ with quasicategories as fibrant objects.
  - Quillen equivalence to the Kan model structure by taking the homotopy coherent nerve?

- **Exercise**: nerve is a Kan complex iff $\cat{C}$ is a groupoid.
- Complete Segal space: a simplicial space $W \Delta\op\to \sSet_{\Kan}$ with some conditions
- $\sSet^{\Delta\op}$ has a model structure where complete Segal spaces are the fibrant objects

- **Exercise**: if $W$ is a complete Segal space then $i_1^* W$ is a quasicategory where $i_1: \Delta \to \Delta^{\times 2}$ sends $[n]$ to $([n], [0])$.

- Limits: isomorphisms on hom sets, or terminal objects in the category of cones:

  - Latter is more universal, only requires pullbacks and cotensors to define?

- Terminal objects: isomorphisms from slice cats to $\cat{C}$:

- Enriched definition of limits:

  ![image_2021-06-05-12-27-23](_attachments/image_2021-06-05-12-27-23.png)

- Terminal objects: $X\slice{x} \mapsvia{\sim} X$ is a weak equivalence in $\sSet_{\qcat}$.

- All definitions of limits in $\inftycat{\infty, 1}$ recover the usual notions via the nerve.

- **Exercise**: Show that the limit of $F: I\to \cat{C}$ is the limit of its nerve?

- Theorem: limit of $F$ in $\sSet_{\qcat}$ is a homotopy limit of its adjoint in $\sSet\dash\Cat_{\Kan}$, and the limit of its adjoint in $\sSet^{\Delta\op}_\CSS$.

- Upshot: many different models, can move between different models.

Things to look up from written notes:

- Picard bundle
- Hasse invariant
- Connection on a bundle
- Frobenius lifting
- $\lambda\dash$rings
- Absolute Galois groups
- Level, weight, and conductor of an elliptic curve
- Local vs global class field theory
- Theta functions

> Talbot, Lyne Moser Part 2

- Next: models of $\inftycat{\infty, 2}$
  - Can take enrichment over $\qcat$ or $\CSS$
- Base change along functor??
- 2-categories: categories enriched in categories
- Recall: $\CSS = \Fun(\Delta\op, \sSet)$.
  We have $\Delta \subseteq \Cat$ a full subcategory, we now want a version for $\ncat{2}$: $\Theta_2\op$.
  Turns out to be wreath product $\Delta\wreath\Delta$.
  Idea: keep track of 2-morphisms, i.e. two-cells, can keep all of their possible compositions

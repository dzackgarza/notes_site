- What is a [Gauss%20sum](Gauss%20sum)?
- What is the *completion* of an [L%20function](L%20function)?
  	Guessing this has to do with continuation.

- What is Dirichlet's trick?

![Types of K theory for monoids](_attachments/image_2021-05-04-14-37-49.png)

- $K'(A)$ defined for partially cancellative $A\dash$sets.
  - Important example: the pointed [monoid](monoid) $\NN \da \ts{\pt, 1, t, t^2, \cdots, }$.

- Useful in [toric%20geometry](toric%20geometry).

![Definition of quasi-exact categories](_attachments/image_2021-05-04-14-43-58.png)

- The category $\Set^\fin_{\ptd}$ of finite pointed sets is quasi-exact, and Barratt-Priddy-Quillen implies that $K(\Set^\fin_\ptd) \homotopic \SS$.
  - If $A$ has no idempotents or units then $K(A) \homotopic \SS$.

- [Group%20completion](Group%20completion): comes from $\Loop^\infty \Suspend^\infty \B G_+$.

- Big theorem: Devissage.
  But I have no clue what this means.
  Seems to say when $\K(A) \cong \K(B)$?

- Apparently easy theorem: $\K'(\NN) \homotopic \SS$.

- See the [cycle%20class%20map](cycle%20class%20map).
  Understanding the image amounts to the [Hodge%20conjecture) and understanding torsion in the image $Z^i(X](../Hodge%20conjecture.md)%20and%20understanding%20torsion%20in%20the%20image%20$Z^i(X)$?

  - See algebraic equivalence in the [Chow%20group](../Chow%20group.md).

- Gysin sequence yields a residue map $\del_x: H^i( \kappa(X); A) \to H^{i-1}( \kappa(X); A)$.

[Gersten%20conjecture](../Gersten%20conjecture.md)

- Interesting parts of the Coniveau spectral sequence: something coming from unramified cohomology, and something coming from algebraic cycles mod algebraic equivalence.

![Failure of integral Hodge conjecture](_attachments/image_2021-05-04-15-17-53.png)

  - Uses [../Bloch-Kato%20conjecture.md](../Bloch-Kato%20conjecture.md)
  - Allows detecting classes in $Z^2(X)$ using [../K-Theory.md](../K-Theory.md) methods.

- See [algebraic%20scheme](algebraic%20scheme), essentially singular homology with a degree shift?

- See [ind-objects](ind-objects) in an arbitrary category.
  - [../scheme.md](../scheme.md).

- Filter by codimension, then obstructions to extending over higher codimension things is measured by cohomology of the [../Function%20field.md](../Function%20field.md):

**Main theorem**,
works not just for smooth schemes, but in greater generality:

- Torsion in the Griffiths group is generally not finitely generated.
  - Use an Enriques surface to produce $(\ZZ/2)^{\oplus \infty}$ in $\Griff^3$.

- See [Abel-Jacobi%20invariants](Abel-Jacobi%20invariants)?

- No Poincaré duality for Chow groups, at least not at the level of cycles.
  Need to pass to cohomology.

  - Dual $\beta$ of $[[../Brauer%20group.md) $\Br(S]]$ of the surface.
  Note $\beta$ is not algebraic.

- Theorem: there exists a [ruled%20surfaces), and $\Br(S) \surjects \Br(S_\eta](ruled%20surfaces),%20and%20$/Br(S)%20/surjects%20/Br(S_/eta)$.
  - $\Br(X_\eta) \cong \ZZ/2$ is generated by an [unramified](unramified) conic bundle. 
  - Can extend conic smoothly over [../central%20fiber.md](../central%20fiber.md)
  - Need that the Poincaré dual [../special%20fiber.md](../special%20fiber.md).

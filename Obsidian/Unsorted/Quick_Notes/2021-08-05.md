- $\SL_2(\RR)\actson \HH$ transitively by linear fractional transformations, and $\Stab(i) = \SO(2)$.
  Thus one can realize $\HH \cong \SL_2(\RR)/\SO_2(\RR)$.
- Applying a homothety to a lattice $\Lambda$ yields $L_\tau \da \ZZ + \ZZ\tau$ for some $\tau\in\HH$ and $\Lambda \cong L_\tau$.
  Writing an elliptic curve as $\CC/L_\tau$, the moduli of elliptic curves is given by 
  \[
A_1\da \SL_2(\ZZ)\diagdown\HH \cong \dcoset{\SL_2(\RR)}{\SL_2(\ZZ)}{\SO_2(\RR)}
  .\]
    This quotient is Hausdorff, and $A_1 \mapsvia{\sim} \CC$ as topological spaces.
    Somehow this comes from "gluing the two bounding lines of $F$ and folding the circular boundary in half," yielding the sphere minus a point.
    - One can naturally compactify this by adding the point at infinity to obtain $X(1) \da \overline{A_1}$.
    This point is referred to as a **cusp**.

- $-I$ acts trivially on $\HH$, so this factors through $\Gamma \da \PSL_2(\ZZ) \da \SL_2(\ZZ)/\gens{\pm I}$.

- Letting \( S= (z\mapsto -1/z) 
= \left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 & -1 \\
1 & 0
\end{array}\right), 
T = (z\mapsto z+1) 
= \left(\begin{array}{ll}
1 & 1 \\
0 & 1
\end{array}\right) \), there are fundamental domains:

- $i$ has isotropy $\gens{S}$, $\zeta_3$ has $\gens{ST}$, and $\zeta_3^2$ has $\gens{TS}$.
  Applying $S$ and $T^{\pm 1}$ to the fundamental domain $F$ tiles $\HH$ by hyperbolic triangles.

- $\PSL_2(\ZZ) = \gens{S, T}$.

- Maps $f: A_1\to \CC$ are continuous iff their pullbacks along $\pi: \HH\to A^1$ are continuous, so these are necessarily $\Gamma\dash$invariant functions.

- $f$ is **automorphic** with automorphy factor $\phi_\gamma(z)$ iff
\[
f(\gamma z) = \phi_\gamma(z) f(z)
.\]
  For any two such functions, their ratio $g=f_1/f_2$ satisfies $g(\gamma z) = g(z)$.

- $f$ is **weakly modular** of **weight $2k$** if
\[
f(z) = (cz+d)^{-2k} f(\gamma z), \gamma \da \matt a b c d
.\]

  - Note that
  \[
  \dd{}{z} {az+b \over cz +d }= {ad-bc \over (cz+d)^2} = {1\over (cz+d)^2}
  ,\]
  and so a meromorphic form $\omega = f(z) \dz$ transforms under $\gamma$ as
  \[
  \gamma \cdot f(z)\dz = f(\gamma \cdot z) d(\gamma\cdot z) = (cz+d)^{-2}f(\gamma\cdot z)\dz
  .\]

  - So weakly modular forms of weight $2k$ are those form which $\omega^{\tensor k}$ is invariant.
  
- Dropping the *weakly* adjective involves imposing holomorphy conditions at $\infty$.
  $f$ is a (standard) **modular form** of **weight $2k$** if $f$ is weakly modular, holomorphic on $\HH$, and the Fourier coefficients satisfy $a_{<0} = 0$.

  - $f$ is a **cusp form** if $a_0 = 0$.

- Poisson summation: if $f:\RR\to \CC$ is a Schwartz function (smooth and super-polynomial decay), then
\[
\sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} f(n)=\sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \widehat{f}(n)
.\]

- $\zeta(s)$ is the $L\dash$function associated to the trivial Galois representation
\[
\rho_{\Triv}: G_\QQ\to \CC\units
.\]
  $L\dash$functions coming from arbitrary 1-dim reps will correspond to Dirichlet characters by Kronecker-Weber, and are referred to as Dirichlet $L\dash$functions.

- $\Gamma(1) \da \SL_2(\ZZ)$, and **principal congruence subgroups of level $N$** for $\Gamma(1)$ are defined as 
\[
\Gamma(N) \da \ker\qty{\Gamma(1) \surjects \SL_2(\ZZ/N)} = \ts{M\in \Gamma(1) \st M\cong I \mod N}
,\]
so the kernels of reduction mod $N$.
**Congruence subgroups** are any subgroups $H$ such that $\Gamma(N) \subseteq H \leq \Gamma(1)$ for some $N$.

- Letting $\Gamma(N)$ act on $\HH$ or $\HH^*$, one can define **modular curves**
\[
X(\Gamma) &\da \Gamma\diagdown \HH^* \\
Y(\Gamma) &\da \Gamma\diagdown \HH 
,\]
where $\HH^* = \HH \union (\QQ \union \ts{\infty}) \subset \PP^1(\CC)$.
  - Note that $Y(1)$ parameterizes elliptic curves.


- The inclusions $\Gamma \injects \Gamma(1)$ induce a branched cover $X(\Gamma) \surjects X(\Gamma(1)) = A^1 \cong \PP^1(\CC)$.

- The genera of these curves can be computed using Riemann-Hurwitz:
\[
2 g(Y)-2=(2 g(X)-2) d+\sum_{y \in Y}\left(e_{y}-1\right)
,\]
yielding for $N\geq 3$, $g(X(\Gamma(N)))$ is given by
\[
g=1+\frac{d(N-6)}{12 N}
\qtext{where}
d=\frac{1}{2}[\Gamma(1): \Gamma(N)]=\frac{N^{3}}{2} \prod\left(1-\frac{1}{p^{2}}\right)
.\]

- For $X$ a smooth curve and $D\in \Div(X)$, set
\[
\Omega^1_X(D) \da \Omega^1_X \tensor \OO_X(D) \cong \OO_X(\omega + D)
\]
where $\omega$ is the canonical divisor.
Then $\globsec{X; \Omega^1_X(D)}$ is the space of meromorphic 1-forms $\omega$ such that $\Div(\omega) + D \geq 0$ is effective.

- Define $M_{2k}(\Gamma)$ to be the space of weight $2k$ modular forms, and $S_{2k}$ the space of cusp forms.
  Then \( \bigoplus_k S_{2k} \in \gr^\ZZ \Alg\slice{\CC}^\fg \), and for $\SL_2(\ZZ)$ this algebra is generated by the Eisenstein series $G_4$ and $G_6$.

- A contravariant functor $F$ admits a **fine moduli space** $\B F$ if $F$ is representable by $\B F$, i.e. $F(\wait) \cong \Hom(\wait, \B F)$.
  By Yoneda, $F$ admits a universal family $\E F \to \B F$ so that $F(X)$ is the pullback of it under some map $X\to \B F$.

- The functor $F(\wait)$ sending $X$ to isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over $X$ admits $Y(1)$ as a **coarse moduli space** and not a fine one, since there are nontrivial families with constant $j\dash$invariant.
  Despite this, $E\to j(E)$ gives a bijection between isomorphism classes of elliptic curves and points of $Y(1)$.

- A level $N$ structure is a basis for $H_1(E; \ZZ/N)$, which is symplectic since it carries a pairing with intersection matrix $\matt 0 1 {-1} 0$.

- Moduli interpretations:
  - $Y_1(N) = Y(\Gamma_1(N))$ is a coarse moduli space for pairs $(E, P)$ where $P$ is an $N\dash$torsion point.
  - $Y_0(N)$ parameterizes $(E, C)$ where $C\leq E[N]$ is a cyclic subgroup of the $N\dash$torsion points.

- An elliptic curve $E$ over a scheme $S$ is a smooth proper map $f:E\to S$ with a section such that the closed fibers of $f$ are genus 1 curves.
  - Letting $\Ell(S)$ be elliptic curves over $S$ up to isomorphism, $Y(1)\slice{\ZZ} = \spec \ZZ[j]$ is a coarse moduli scheme for $\Ell(\wait)$, and $Y(1) = \qty{Y(1)\slice{\ZZ} \fiberprod{\spec \ZZ} \spec \CC}^\an$ is the associated analytic space.

- Look up the [[Weil Pairing]] $e_n$.

- A level $N$ structure is a pair of points $P, Q \in E[N]$ generating a subgroup with that $e_n(P, Q) = \zeta_N$ is a primitive $N$th root of unity.
  More generally, for curves over schemes, this is a pair of sections inducing level structures on closed fibers.

- For $N=2$, $Y(2) = \spec \ZZ \adjoin{t, {1\over t(t-1)}}$ as a coarse moduli space, and a corresponding almost-universal family $y^2z = x(x-z)(x-tz)$.

- For $N=3$, $Y(2) = \spec R\adjoin{t, {1\over t^3-1}}$ where $R \da \ZZ\adjoin{{1\over 3}, \zeta_3^2}$ for $\zeta_3$ a primitive third root of unity.
  The universal family is $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3txyz$, where the level 3 structure is given by the sections $\tv{-1, 0, 1}, [-1, \zeta_3^2, 0]$.

## Moduli as Stacks

- Can view an elliptic curve as a pair $(X, p)$ where $X$ is a compact Riemann surface with $\dim_\CC H^0(X; \Omega^1_X) = 1$ and $p$ is a point.

  - Why elliptic curves have 1-dimensional homology: any globally defined holomorphic 1-form is a double periodic holomorphic 1-form on $\HH$, forcing it to be constant by Liouville.
:
- Can define a lattice $\Lambda \subseteq V$ in an arbitrary vector space as a discrete cocompact subgroup, so $V/\Lambda$ is compact.

- The **order** of a function $f$ at $x$ is given by 

\[
\text { ord }_{x}(f):= \begin{cases}0 & \text { if } \mathrm{f} \text { is holomorphic and non-zero at } x \\ k & \text { if } \mathrm{f} \text { has a zero of order } k \text { at } x \\ -k & \text { if } \mathrm{f} \text { has a pole of order } k \text { at } x\end{cases}
.\]

- Can define divisors as maps $D:X\to \ZZ$ where cofinitely many points are sent to zero.
  The map $\ord_{\wait}(f)$ is a divisor associated to any function $f$, denoted $(f)$.

- Divisors $(f)$ for $f$ meromorphic are principal, and setting $\deg(\sum n_i p_i) \da \sum n_o$, it turns out that $\deg((f)) = 0$ for $f$ principal.
  - As a consequence, meromorphic functions have equal numbers of zeros and poles, and 1-forms that are not identically zero can not have zeros.

- The **period map** is defined as
\[
\Phi: H_{1}(X, \mathbb{Z}) & \rightarrow \mathbb{C} \\
\gamma & \mapsto \int_{\gamma} \omega
.\]
For a fixed nonzero holomorphic 1-form $\omega$, there is a group pf **periods** which forms a lattice over $\CC$:
\[
\Lambda \da \ts{\int_\gamma \omega \in \CC \st \gamma \in H_1(X; \ZZ)} = \im\Phi
.\]
  One can recover $(X, P)$ as $(\CC/\Lambda(\omega), 0)$

- Brauer groups, Azumaya algebras
  - This is some $H^2$ perhaps? Like $\Br(X) = H^2(X; \GG_m)$?
    Need to figure out what kind of cohomology this is though.
- Brauer-Manin pairing, Tate pairing
- degree of cycles on Chow
- central fiber, formal schemes
  - There is a sensible way to define Brauer groups for formal schemes as a holim
- $\lim^1$
- See GAGA principle
- Morita theory: for $R\in \Ring, A,B\in \Alg_{R}$, $A\sim B$ are Morita equivalent iff $\mods{A} \equiv \modsleft{B}$, and $A$ is Azumaya if it's invertible in the following sense: there is an $A'$ such that $A\tensor A' \sim R$
  - Can identify $\Fun(\modsleft{A}, \modsleft{B}) \cong \bimod{A^\op}{B}$
- Presentable infinity categories 
- Part of an equivalence: take a compact generator, take its endomorphism algebra, take category of modules over that algebra?
- See Ã©tale descent and Zariski descent
- Invertible implies dualizable but not conversely.
- Smooth and proper: dualizable?
- See perfect complexes
  - See formal GAGA for perfect complexes

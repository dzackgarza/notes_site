Generalized Topological Poincaré Conjecture
===========================================

When is a homotopy sphere also a topological sphere?

When does $\pi_* X \cong_{Grp} \pi_* S^n \implies X \cong_{Top} S^n$?

-   $n=1$: True. Trivial
-   $n=2$: True. Proved by Poincaré, classical
-   $n=3$: True. Perelman (2006) using Ricci flow + surgery
-   $n=4$: True. Freedman (1982), Fields medal!
-   $n=5$: True. Zeeman (1961)
-   $n=6$: True. Stalling (1962)
-   $n\geq 7$: True. Smale (1961) using h-cobordism theorem, uses handle decomposition + Morse functions

Smooth Poincaré Conjecture
==========================

When is a homotopy sphere a *smooth* sphere?

-   $n=1$: True. Trivial
-   $n=2$: True. Proved by Poincaré, classical
-   $n=3$: True. (Top = PL = Smooth)
-   $n=4$: **Open**
-   $n=5$: Zeeman (1961)
-   $n=6$: Stalling (1962)
-   $n\geq 7$: False in general (Milnor and Kervaire, 1963), Exotic $S^n$, 28 smooth structures on $S^7$

**Remarks**:

-   It is unknown whether or not \$`{\mathbb{B}}`{=tex}\^4 \$ admits an exotic smooth structure. If not, the smooth 4-dimensional Poincaré conjecture would have an affirmative answer.

-   Current line of attack: [Gluck twists](Gluck%20twists) on on $S^4$. Yield homeomorphic spheres, *suspected* not to be diffeomorphic, but no known invariants can distinguish smooth structures on $S^4$.

> Take a look at Machlachlan and Reid's book "The Arithmetic of Hyperbolic 3-Manifolds".

> Since finite volume hyperbolic structures are unique whenever an n-manifold (n≥3) has them, any invariants of the hyperbolic structure are invariants of the manifold. Hyperbolic manifolds are K(π,1)-spaces, so they're not just diffeo/homeomorphism invariants, but invariants of the homotopy-type.

-   Rohklin invariant: a ${\mathbb{Z}}/2$ invariant $r$ for $\mathbb{Z}\operatorname{HS}^3$
-   Casson invariant: a ${\mathbb{Z}}$ invariant $c$ for $\mathbb{Z}\operatorname{HS}^3$ where $c\operatorname{mod}2 = r$.

Requires 2-dualizability.

Determine a TFT...?

The cobordism hypothesis may be interpreted as the assertion that extended topological field theories are completely determined by the higher category formed by boundary conditions and their interfaces.
For example in two dimensions a topological gauge theory with gauge group G is determined by specifying the class of G-quantum mechanics that form boundary conditions, while in three dimensions we need to specify a class of two-dimensional field theories with G symmetry

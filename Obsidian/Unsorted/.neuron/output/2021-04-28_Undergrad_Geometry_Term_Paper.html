Abstract
=============

The primary purpose of this paper is to discuss Alexandre
Grothendieck, who is often cited as one of the most influential
mathematical thinkers of the century. In order to fully appreciate the
impact of his contributions, it is necessary to provide some
historical context in which to place his work, and to this end, this
paper will also discuss some the history, and mathematical content of
Algebraic Geometry, as well as several key figures in the field.

This topic was chosen because of the significance of Grothendieck&#39;s
accomplishments and the legacy he has left on modern mathematical
theory, but also because it allows place the field of Geometry in a
wider context, with a narrative that spans from the time of the Greeks
to the proof of the infamous last theorem of Fermat near the turn of
the century. In particular, the interplay between Algebra and Geometry
has a rich and storied history, including a unification between the
two fields that has advanced rapidly in the past two to three
centuries.

Treating this subject cohesively will require not only examining the
historical context, however -- in order to fully appreciate the impact
of some modern results, it will be necessary to cover introduce some
mathematical content as well. To this end, this paper does not seek to
provide a rigorous treatment of Algebraic Geometry -- many references
are provided in the reference section that serve this purpose quite
nicely.

Instead, such mathematical inclusions are meant to inform the
historical narrative, and so attention will be restricted to only
those definitions that provide a common and unifying language in which
to frame the results that are mentioned. It is often touted that the
field of Algebraic Geometry is somewhat obtuse and rife with &quot;heavy
mathematical machinery&quot; -- it is for this reason that a secondary goal
of this paper is to help demystify the subject, and perhaps provide
some motivations for why such mathematical machinery would be
invented, and why it has earned its place as a rich and distinguished
field of mathematical inquiry.

Ultimately, the goal of this paper is to discuss Grothendieck&#39;s
pioneering use of *schemes*, a construct introduced in his well-known
1957 &#39;Tohoku&#39; paper, which helped lay a new framework for Algebraic
Geometry and has driven advances in the field ever since. In order to
understand the significance of schemes, however, one must first
understand *sheaves*, the construct that schemes are meant to
generalize and extend. Sheaves, in turn, are in many ways defined
analogously to *manifolds*, which are often thought of as spaces that
locally resemble standard Euclidean space, and it is from this
construct that a great deal of geometric intuition can be derived and
used to guide powerful algebraic generalizations.


A Historical Perspective {#header-n30}
========================

The Greeks {#header-n31}
----------

Algebraic Geometry is among the oldest branches of mathematics, which
was studied as early as 400 BCE by the Greeks in the form of conic
sections. For the Greeks, in fact, the division between Algebra and
Geometry was perhaps indistinguishable in either direction. Without the
benefits of a numeral system amenable to calculations, nor the
convenient symbolic shorthand used in modern mathematics, the very
problems they studied were inextricably tied to the geometric situations
from which they were born.

![An Algebraic Identity Expressed Geometrically](figures/identity.png){#fig:my_label2 width=&quot;\\linewidth&quot;}

Because the Greeks worked not primarily with individual number, but
instead *magnitudes*: lengths, areas, volumes, and ratios thereof.
Because of this, algebraic identities such as
$$(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$$ would have been expressed in terms of
relationships between geometric figures -- in this case, perhaps as
rearrangements of certain squares and rectangles, as shown in the figure
above.

Of primary interest to the Greeks was the solution of algebraic
equations by means of examining the intersection of algebraic curves. In
this way, they were led to study the *conic sections*, those curves
which can be obtained by intersecting a plane with the surface of a
cone. In modern parlance, one might refer to such sections as those
traced out by real numbers $x$ and $y$ that satisfy a relationship of
the form $$Ax^2 +By^2 + Cxy + Dx + Ey + F = 0,$$ where the coefficients
$A$ through $F$ are also taken to be real. Despite not quite having the
algebraic notation to state the problem in this form nor the benefit of
modern analytic and algebraic tools, the Greeks were able to
characterize all such sections, yielding circles, ellipses, hyperbolas,
parabolas, straight lines, and the degenerate case of a single point.

![A Circle](figures/Selection_050.png){#fig:gull width=&quot;\\textwidth&quot;}

![A Parabola](figures/Selection_051.png){#fig:tiger width=&quot;\\textwidth&quot;}

![An Ellipse](figures/Selection_052.png){#fig:mouse width=&quot;\\textwidth&quot;}

![A Hyperbola](figures/Selection_053.png){#fig:gull2 width=&quot;\\textwidth&quot;}

![Two Lines](figures/Selection_055.png){#fig:tiger2 width=&quot;\\textwidth&quot;}

![A Single Point](figures/Selection_054.png){#fig:mouse2 width=&quot;\\textwidth&quot;}

Accordingly, the Greeks were aware of methods (for example) to solve
problems such as &quot;squaring the rectangle&quot;, to which one might associate
equations of the form $x^2 = ab$, regarding the quantity $x^2$ as the
area of a unknown square and both $a$ and $b$ as known side lengths. In
their mathematical framework, all such constructions were necessarily
geometric in nature, and were thus restricted to those which could be
obtained with use of a compass and straightedge. In these terms, such a
problem might be cast as finding the solutions $x$ that instead satisfy
the cross-ratio $$\frac{x}{b} = \frac{a}{x}$$

A similar example is the problem of &quot;doubling the cube&quot; -- that is,
given a cube with known side lengths, constructing a second cube with
exactly twice the volume of the first. This amounts to finding $x$ that
satisfy a similar ratio, $$\frac{x^3}{a^3} = \frac{b}{a}$$ Considering
the simplest case of the unit cube led to questions concerning whether
number such as $\sqrt[3]{2}$ were constructible in the geometric sense
described above, a question that would remain unsolved until the advent
of the algebraic tools of Galois Theory in the century.

However, although in many cases the Greeks made use of coordinates,
their study of geometry did not have the same analytic flavor that it
takes on today -- the modern notion of a coordinate system would not
enter the mathematical zeitgeist until nearly the century, with the work
of Rene Descartes. Moreover, the classical study was restricted to
algebraic curves in at most 3 dimensions, and usually over fields such
as $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{Q}$, and so it remained until the &quot;Geometric
Renaissance&quot; of the and centuries.

Modern Times {#header-n42}
------------

Due to reverence of the infamous fifth postulate of Euclid, the study of
*synthetic geometry* -- that built on a collection axiomatic foundations
-- remained the dominant mode of Geometric thought. With the advent of
Cartesian coordinates, however, a separate study of *analytic* (or
coordinate) geometry began, coinciding with the beginning of the study
of alternative geometries based upon negating the fifth postulate.
However, the unreasonable effectiveness of coordinates in applications
to science and engineering endeavors, along with the invention of
Calculus in the mid century, led to the flourishing of the analytic
branch in favor of synthetic approaches.

And so it remained until roughly the century -- it was at this point in
time that it began to become apparent that alternative and equally valid
non-Euclidean geometries could arise from the negation of the fifth
postulate, leading to the study of elliptic and hyperbolic geometries.
In particular, during this period there was a resurgence of the field of
*projective geometry*, which was originally studied by Brunelleschi as
the &quot;geometry of perspective&quot; in the century, and reformulated in terms
of &quot;points at infinity&quot; around the century by Kepler and Desargues.

Around this time, a notion of *affine geometry* had also come into the
picture, which is roughly characterized as a generalization of Euclidean
geometry in which the notion of absolute distance is forgotten, and the
concepts that remain meaningful are instead the notions of parallel
lines, collinearity, and the preservation of certain ratios. It was
known early on that Euclidean geometry could be recovered as a special
case of projective geometry, and as affine geometry and new
non-Euclidean geometries were discovered, it was soon thought that *all*
such geometries could in fact be recovered in such a way, making
projective geometry a more general and universal theory.

A major proponent of this point of view in the century was Felix Klein
(of Klein Bottle fame), who sought to classify all geometries with his
*Erlangen Program*. He believed that projective geometry would provide a
unifying framework under which all other geometries could be united, and
introduced the idea that such geometries could be characterized using
the theory of groups. It was with the advent of Klein&#39;s program that
traditionally synthetic approaches found rigorous footing in analytic
and algebraic notions.

The Erlangen Program {#header-n51}
====================

Euclidean Geometries
--------------------

In particular, the *Erlangen* program laid out a framework in which any
given geometry could be categorized as a group of symmetries acting on a
vector space, and it is of some interest to see how such constructions
can yield familiar geometries.

For example, fix some field $k$ -- in the familiar setting, one might
choose $\mathbb{R}$, but many interesting ideas can be brought to light
by considering the general case. One can choose a coordinate system and
consider sets of ordered $n$-tuples
$$k^n \coloneqq\{ (k_1, k_2, \cdots k_n) \mid k_i \in k \}.$$ Equipping
this set with the usual point-wise operations of addition and scalar
multiplication, a vector space $V_k$ of $n$ dimensions over the base
field $k$ can be obtained. With a vector space in hand, one can consider
linear maps from $V_k$ to itself (sometimes referred to as *operators*),
and if $n$ is finite, these are entirely characterized by $n\times n$
square matrices. In particular, one can form groups of such matrices by
equipping them with the usual notion of matrix multiplication, and
examine the actions of these groups on $V_k$.

Since several such groups will be useful in recovering familiar
geometries, a few definitions are in order. In each situation, it will
be assumed that $k$ is a field, and $V_k$ is a vector space of finite
dimension $n$ over the field $k$.

::: {.definition}
**Definition 1**. The set of $n\times m$ matrices with entries in $k$
will be denoted $M_{n,m}(k)$. If $n=m$, this will simply be abbreviated
to $M_n(k)$, which denotes the set of $n\times n$ (or *square*) matrices
over $k$.
:::

In general, a square matrix is equivalently a mapping from $V_k$ to
itself, which can be realized via matrix-vector multiplication. One is
often interested in such mappings that are invertible, which prompts the
next definition.

::: {.definition}
**Definition 2**. The *general linear group of dimension $n$,*
$GL_n(K)$, is the group defined by the set
$$GL_n(K) \coloneqq\{ M \in M_n(k) \mid \det (M) \neq 0 \},$$ equipped
with matrix multiplication. Equivalently, this is the set of invertible
(and necessarily square) matrices with entries in $k$.
:::

The general linear group can alternatively be characterized as a
representation of the set of invertible linear operators on $V_k$,
equipped with function composition. For the purpose of this discussion,
this group is quite large, so we will be interested in certain
subgroups.

::: {.definition}
**Definition 3**. The *orthogonal group of dimension $n$*, $O_n(k)$, is
defined as the set
$$O_n(k) \coloneqq\{ M \in GL_n(k) \mid MM^T = I \},$$ equipped with
matrix multiplication, where $M^T$ denotes the transpose of a matrix and
$I$ denotes the unique $n\times n$ matrix that satisfies $AI = IA = A$
for every $A\in M_n(K)$.
:::

It can be shown $O_n(k)$ is in fact a subgroup of $GL_n(k)$.
Equivalently, it can be characterized by those matrices $M$ for which
$M^{-1}$ = $M^T$, or equivalently those for which $\det M = \pm 1$. If
one takes $k=\mathbb{R}$, these are exactly the distance-preserving
transformations (often referred to as *isometries*) of $\mathbb{R}^n$
that preserve the origin. Taking the dimension to be either 2 or 3
reveals that this produces a group consisting of both rotations around
the origin, and reflections *through* the origin.

In Euclidean geometry, one is also interested in translating and
transporting one figure to another point in space, which motivates the
next definition.

::: {.definition}
**Definition 4**. The *group of translations* in vector space $V_k$ of
dimension $n$ is denoted $T_n(k)$, and is equivalent to $k^n$, the set
of all $n$-tuples with entries in $k$.
:::

The above definition is a consequence of the fact that any translation
can be identified with a vector along which the translation occurs,
which does not depend on the point being considered.

Equipped with these definitions, we can finally define one of the main
groups of interest that will help characterize Euclidean geometry:

::: {.definition}
**Definition 5**. The *Euclidean group of dimension n* is the group
defined by $E_n(k) \coloneqq T_n(k) \rtimes O_n(k)$, the semi-direct
group product of the group of translations with the orthogonal group.
:::

The purpose of this definition is to capture some of what is already
known about Euclidean geometry -- it is invariant under rigid motions
(or isometries), which can, in turn, be characterized by combinations of
translations, rotations, and reflections about lines. It is these exact
types of motions that preserve the essential elements of classical
Euclidean geometry -- length, angle, ratios, parallel lines, and
intersections of lines.

While defining the notion of a semidirect product is perhaps outside the
scope of this paper, it happens to be the exact algebraic tool that
describes how such isometries can be constructed. In this case, it
captures the notion the if one first performs a translation, followed by
a rotation or reflection, this motion can equivalently be carried out by
first performing the rotation or reflection, and then translating by the
new rotated or reflected image of the original translation vector.

Taking a field such as $\mathbb{R}$ and the dimension of $n=2$, we find
that the vector space $\mathbb{R}^2$ along with the group
$E_2(\mathbb{R})$ provides enough information to recover classical
Euclidean geometry in the plane.

Affine Geometries {#header-n86}
-----------------

In the affine case, one is often interested in maps
$T: k^n \rightarrow k^n$ of the form $v \mapsto Mv + b$ where $M$ is a
linear translation and $b$ is another vector in $k^n$. These maps are
often called *affine transformations*, and spaces that result from
quotienting by this action are *affine spaces*, which are often
described as &quot;vector spaces in which the origin is forgotten.&quot; Another
way of stating this is that allowing the morphisms to be combinations of
both linear maps *and* translations obviates the need for a
distinguished zero vector, and allows one to equivalently treat similar
figures without reference to an absolute coordinate system.

While this may seem like an abstract notion, it is, in fact, one that is
commonly and implicitly used by anyone who has worked with vector spaces
in any capacity: vector spaces are in fact affine spaces over
themselves. It is this fact that allows one to denote a *vector* in this
space by an $n$-tuple of points, and to interchangeably use the same
notation for a *point* of that space. Similarly, one commonly uses the
affine structure of a vector space when transporting a vector to a
chosen origin and treating it equivalently to the original vector.

Affine transformations are themselves more general than linear
transformations. For one, linear maps must preserve the origin, sending
zero to zero, while affine maps may not. In addition to the rotations
and translations present in the Euclidean case, elements of the affine
group additionally may induce both uniform and non-uniform scaling, as
well as shearing of figures. And in contrast to the Euclidean case,
affine transformations do not in general preserve angles and distances
-- they do, however, still preserve straight lines, and send parallel
lines to parallel lines.

In order to obtain this type of geometry in the framework of the
Erlangen program, one can carry out similar constructions to arrive at
the following result:

::: {.definition}
**Definition 6**. The *affine group of dimension $n$* is defined as
$Aff_n(k) \coloneqq T_n(k) \rtimes GL_n(k)$.
:::

As noted previously, the group $O_n(k)$ is a subgroup of $GL_n(k)$, and
so this result suggested to Klein and his contemporaries that Euclidean
geometry was, in fact, a restriction, or special case, of affine
geometry.

Projective Geometries {#header-n99}
---------------------

In the case of projective geometry, one wants to introduce a notion of
&quot;perspective projection&quot; in addition to the isometries obtained in the
Euclidean and Affine cases. However, in order to do so, one must forego
the preservation of parallel lines. This is a consequence of the early
study of the subject, with respect to capturing 3-dimensional images on
a 2-dimensional medium. This required the introduction of a point at
which all parallel lines in the image would meet, which is now referred
to as a *vanishing point* or a *point at infinity*.

![Using a Vanishing Point for Perspective
Projection](figures/vanishing.png){#fig:my_label width=&quot;0.8\\linewidth&quot;}

To see why Klein considered Projective geometry to be the most general
and universal among the geometries known at his time, it suffices to
carry out a similar construction in the projective case. One first takes
a vector space $V_k$, constructs a group that will act as the symmetries
that preserve the desired properties, and identifies the geometry as the
space that remains invariant under such a group action. In the
projective case, the group itself is constructed in a slightly different
way, and so a definition from group theory is needed.

::: {.definition}
**Definition 7**. Given a group $G$, the *center* of a group $Z(G)$ is
defined as $Z(G) \coloneqq\{ g\in G \mid gh = hg ~\forall h\in G \}$,
the set of elements that commute with every other element of the group.
:::

::: {.definition}
**Definition 8**. The *projective linear group of dimension $n-1$* is
the group defined by $PGL_{n-1}(k) = GL_n(k) / Z(GL_n(k))$, the general
linear group quotiented by its center.
:::

The $n+1$ condition is the first noticeable difference, which arises
from the fact that a projective space of dimension $n$ is obtained from
a vector space of dimension $n+1$, and the projective transformations
(often called *homographies*) are induced by the linear transformations
in that vector space. Such projective transformations play an important
role in complex analysis, where one can realize the *Mobius group*
$PGL_2(\mathbb{C})$ as fractional linear transformations on the Riemann
sphere $\mathbb{C}\cup \{ \infty \}$, which could equivalently be
denoted the *complex projective line*.

It can then be shown that, for fixed $k$ and $n$, both the Euclidean and
Affine groups are isomorphic to subgroups of the Projective group, and
it is in this way that those geometries can be recovered as special
cases of projective geometry.

Into the Century
================

Post-Erlangen Program {#header-n112}
---------------------

Armed with the tools of the Erlangen program, geometry once again become
an active mathematical research topic and its impact rippled throughout
the and centuries. It was one of the first moderately successful modern
attempts to provide a unifying framework under which many disparate
parts of mathematics could be connected and derived from one another,
revealing new connections and insights.

It is a fact that the program was not all-encompassing - for example,
the recently developed Riemannian geometry did not easily fit into this
framework. But perhaps its most significant and lasting impact on
Mathematics lies in its cultural effects, and in particular, in the way
it affected how mathematical knowledge was organized and synthesized. It
proved the usefulness of having such unifying frameworks, a theme that
would become prominent in the century, and laid the groundwork for the
philosophy that would drive the development of category theory in the
1940s.

The Italian School {#header-n104}
------------------

Meanwhile, the field of Algebraic Geometry progressed somewhat
independently, but it became clear that affine and projective spaces
were fundamental to the subject, as were functions (and particularly
polynomials) on those spaces. Major work was done in this area in the
late and early centuries by a group referred to as &quot;The Italian School&quot;
in Rome, primarily driven by the work of Severi, Castelnuovo, and
Enriques. In order to discuss the significance of their work, however,
it is necessary to introduce several more definitions.

::: {.definition}
**Definition 9**. *Affine $n$-space* over a field $k$, denoted $A^n(k)$
is defined as the set of $n$-tuples $(k_1, k_2, \cdots k_n)$, along with
the information of the vector spaces $V_k$ of dimension $n$ over $k$ and
the action of the affine group $Aff_n(k)$ on $V_k$.
:::

In many ways, this is very similar to the vector space $k^n$ defined
previously, and in fact, there is a map $k^n \rightarrow A^n(k)$ that is
colloquially referred to as &quot;forgetting the origin&quot;, and a reverse map
$A^n(k) \rightarrow k^n$ that amounts to choosing a coordinate system.
An affine space is chosen generally when one doesn&#39;t need the full
structure of a vector space, but would still like to consider notions
such as points, relative distances, collinearity, and the other
isometries preserved by the affine group.

If one then fixes some multivariate polynomial $p$ in the polynomial
ring $k[x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n]$ over $n$ indeterminates with
coefficients in $k$, one can examine points of the form
$$\bar{a} = (a_1, a_2, \cdots a_n)$$ in $A^n(k)$ such that
$p(a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n) = 0$. The collection of such points is
referred to as the *zero locus* of such a polynomial, or equivalently an
*algebraic hypersurface*.

For example, take $k=\mathbb{R}$ and consider polynomials of degree 2 in
$k[x,y]$. In generality, the hypersurface of such a polynomial $p(x,y)$
will be defined by the relation
$$p(x,y) = Ax^2 + By^2 + Cxy + Dx + Ey + F = 0,$$ where the coefficients
$A-F$ are taken to be real numbers. But this exactly describes the
general equation of a conic section, as studied by the Greeks, and so we
find that this new notion of a hypersurface perfectly generalizes
algebraic surfaces such as conic sections, but allows for variation in
both dimension and base field.

This prompts the following definition:

::: {.definition}
**Definition 10**. Given a set $S\subseteq k[x_1, x_2, \cdots x_n]$ of
the form $S = \{ p_1, p_2, \cdots p_m \}$, the *affine algebraic variety
of $S$* is defined as
$$V(S) \coloneqq\{ \bar{a} \mid \bar{a} \in A^n(k), ~ p_i(\bar{a}) = 0~ \forall p_i \in S \}.$$
(Note that the set $S$ is sometimes referred to as a *system* of
polynomials.)
:::

In other words, one can take a number of polynomials and consider the
points where they *simultaneously* vanish, which is equivalent to
looking at the intersections of their associated hypersurfaces, and
combine all of this information into a structure called a *variety*. It
is these objects -- roughly speaking, the zero loci of polynomials --
that form one of the fundamental structures upon which much Algebraic
Geometry is based.

To see why such an object may be interesting, take $k=\mathbb{R}$, the
ring $k[x,y]$, and consider the polynomial $$p_1(x,y) = y^2-x^3.$$ The
variety $V(\{ p1 \})$ traces out an *algebraic curve* in the $x$-$y$
plane, shown in the first figure below. In contrast, consider also the
polynomial $$p_2(x,y) = y^2-x^3+x,$$ then $V(\{ p_2 \})$ is also an
algebraic curve, as shown in the second figure. Finally, consider
$$p_3(x,y) = y^{2} - x^{3}-3x^{2},$$ shown in the third figure.

 

 

An immediate qualitative difference is that $p_1$ has a &quot;cusp&quot; near 0,
where it may be unclear what the correct assignment of a tangent line
should be, while the second is &quot;smooth&quot; but also has a &quot;double point&quot; at
which there are two possible choices for a tangent line. The third, on
the other hand, does not seem to exhibit any such irregularities, and is
in fact an *elliptic curve*, an object with a rich analytic and
algebraic structure.

The types of irregularities present in $p1$ and $p2$ are in general
referred to as *singularities* of the curve, and so one might be
inclined to wonder what causes such singularities to occur, and if there
are perhaps conditions on the polynomials themselves that might
guarantee that the curves generated contain no such singularities.

Such questions drove many results in the classification of algebraic
curves and it was found that the *genus* associated to the curve, an
essentially topological property, was a powerful tool in such
classifications. It was the extension of these ideas to the
classification algebraic *surfaces* in higher dimensions that the
Italian school focused their efforts on. To this end, many results were
produced, but their results and methods of proof have remained
contentious throughout the century.

The Weil Conjectures and Grothendieck {#header-n127}
-------------------------------------

Various progress in other areas of geometry was made throughout the
first half of the century, most notably the advances of Hilbert and his
proof of the *Nullstellensatz* (roughly translated as &quot;theorem of zero
loci&quot;). Recalling that a variety was defined over system $S$ of
polynomials, where $S$ is contained in some polynomial ring
$k[x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n]$, one form of the *Nullstellensatz* shows that
if one wants to check whether the variety $V(S)$ is nonempty, one can
equivalently check whether $S$ is a (proper) ideal in this ring. This
firmly cemented the link between Algebra and Geometry, providing a
bridge that allowed many of the tools from either one of these fields to
be used in the other.

Around 1950, a mathematician named Andre Weil set forth &quot;The Weil
Conjectures&quot;, three proposals that stem from setting $k$ to be a finite
field, considering the resulting varieties, and defining analogs of the
Riemann-Zeta function in order to count the number of rational points on
the resulting algebraic curves. Weil conjectured that certain properties
similar to the traditional Zeta function should hold, particularly with
respect to the locations of their zeros.

In doing so, he was able to formulate an analog of the Riemann
Hypothesis for these situations, and further conjectured that many of
the newly formed tools of homological algebra could be brought to bear
on such a problem. Homological tools had proved to be both powerful and
successful in topology in the first half of the century, and it was at
this point that many researchers were beginning to generalize such
theories and apply them to other areas. In particular, Weil suspected
that applying homological methods from algebraic topology to these
conjectures would have significant number-theoretic ramifications.

It is here that Alexandre Grothendieck enters the picture, as well as
his contemporary John-Pierre Serre, for within 15 years Grothendieck had
published solutions to two out of three of these conjectures. In the
process, he introduced many of the tools that would become standard in
modern Algebraic Geometry -- his major contributions being in the
development of the necessary homological tools, a cohomology theory for
varieties. Such contributions were framed within the recently developed
language of category theory, and included the definitions of abelian
categories, derived functors, injective resolutions, schemes, and
sheaves.

Grothendieck&#39;s general approach, which has gained traction widely across
mathematics in the resulting years, was noticing that certain classes of
geometric objects could be characterized by instead considering all of
the maps *into* that object from other similar objects. In particular,
this applies to algebraic variety -- one can associate to a given
variety a collection of particularly well-behaved functions on that
variety, the so-called &quot;regular&quot; functions, and in this way study the
variety itself.

This collection of functions constitutes the simplest example of a
*sheaf*, modulo a number of technical conditions. Perhaps more
surprisingly, this collection forms a ring. Given any ring $R$, one can
form the set of prime ideals of $R$, denoted $\text{Spec}(R)$, and even
equip with with a topology (what is usually referred to as the *Zariski
topology*. If one then introduces a topological space into the picture,
there is a construction entitled the *structure sheaf* on the space
which contains information about the functions on that space, and taking
a topological space along with such a structure sheaf produces what is
known as a *scheme*.

Although the construction of scheme itself is quite a bit more detailed
and nuanced than what has been described here, its power lies in its
similarity to notions in differential geometry, where homological
methods had been successfully applied prior to Grothendieck. It is in
this way that many powerful tools from the study of manifolds can be
generalized to work on algebraic objects, and similarly to allow
advances in the algebraic theory of rings to be brought to bear on
geometric problems.

However, such constructions proved to not just be limited to making
connections between geometry, topology, and algebra, but as Weil had
hoped, laid the groundwork for many of these tools to be applied to
number theory. This culminated in the celebrated proof of Fermat&#39;s Last
Theorem by Andrew Wiles in the 1990s, which built upon on many of the
tools developed during this period.

Conclusion
==========

In summary, perhaps the most notable influence of Algebraic Geometry on
the face of mathematics has been the bridges it has created between
different fields. In its study, many mathematical &quot;Rosetta Stones&quot; have
been built, allowing deeper connections to be built between seemingly
disparate fields of mathematics, and moreover making possible the
transport of powerful techniques across these domains. In the latter
half of the century, Grothendieck left the world of Mathematics, and
spent most of his remaining days in solitude, living in the Pyrenees
until his death in 2014. And although mathematics is not a lone
endeavor, it is particularly hard to overstate the singular
contributions of Grothendieck, for his ideas continue to shape how
modern mathematics is formulated.

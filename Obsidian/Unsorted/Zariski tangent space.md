-   Can be defined by taking defining equations $\left\{{f_i}\right\}_{i=1}^r \subseteq k[x_1, \cdots, x_{n}]$, taking the matrix of partials ${\left[ {{\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}\,}} \right]}$, which evaluating at a point $p$ yields a map $Df: {\mathbb{F}}^n \to {\mathbb{F}}^r$ where ${\mathbb{F}}$ is the [residue field](residue%20field) at $p$.
    -   Then define the **Zariski tangent space** as $\ker D_f$.

- Can be defined by taking defining equations $\ts{f_i}_{i=1}^r \subseteq \kx{n}$, taking the matrix of partials $\tv{\dd{f_i}{x_j}}$, which evaluating at a point $p$ yields a map $Df: \FF^n \to \FF^r$ where $\FF$ is the [[residue field]] at $p$.
	- Then define the **Zariski tangent space** as $\ker D_f$.

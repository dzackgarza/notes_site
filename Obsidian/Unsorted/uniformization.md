Uniformization Theorem
======================

The uniformization theorem says that every simply connected Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to one of the three Riemann surfaces: the open unit disk, the complex plane, or the Riemann sphere. In particular it implies that every Riemann surface admits a Riemannian metric of constant curvature.

For compact [[Riemann%20surface.md | Riemann%20surface.html]],

-   Those with universal cover the unit disk are precisely the hyperbolic surfaces of genus greater than 1, all with non-abelian fundamental group;
-   Those with universal cover the complex plane are the Riemann surfaces of genus 1, namely the complex tori or elliptic curves with fundamental group ${\mathbb{Z}}^{\ast 2}$;
-   Those with universal cover the Riemann sphere are those of genus 0, namely the Riemann sphere itself, with trivial fundamental group.

The [[uniformization.md | uniformization.html]] theorem is a generalization of the Riemann mapping theorem from proper simply connected open subsets of the plane to arbitrary simply connected Riemann surfaces.

Every Riemann surface is the quotient of a free, proper and holomorphic action of a discrete group on its universal covering and this universal covering is holomorphically isomorphic (one also says: "conformally equivalent" or "biholomorphic") to one of the following:

1.  the Riemann sphere
2.  the complex plane
3.  the unit disk in the complex plane.

In 3 dimensions, there are 8 geometries, called the eight [[geometrization%20conjecture | geometrization%20conjecture.html]] proved by Grigori Perelman states that every 3-manifold can be cut into pieces that are geometrizable.

Smooth Category: Uniformization
-------------------------------

Generally expect things to split into more classes.

-   Dimension 0: The point (terminal object)
-   Dimension 1: ${\mathbb{S}}^1, {\mathbb{R}}^1$
-   Dimension 2: $\left\langle{{\mathbb{S}}^2, {\mathbb{T}}^2, {\mathbb{RP}}^2 {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}{\mathbb{S}}^2 = 0,\,\,3{\mathbb{RP}}^2 = {\mathbb{RP}}^2 + {\mathbb{T}}^2 }\right\rangle$.
    -   Classified by $\pi_1$ (orientability and "genus"). Riemann, Poincare, Klein.
    -   Every surface admits a complex structure and a metric. Thus always orientable.
    -   Uniformization: Holomorphically equivalent to a quotient of one of three spaces/geometries:
        -   ${\mathbb{CP}}^1$, positive curvature (spherical)\
        -   ${\mathbb{C}}$, zero curvature (flat, Euclidean)
        -   ${\mathbb{H}}$ (equiv. ${\mathbb{D}}^\circ$), negative curvature (hyperbolic)
    -   Stratified by genus:
        -   Genus 0: Only ${\mathbb{CP}}^1$
        -   Genus 1: All of the form ${\mathbb{C}}/\Lambda$, with a distinguished point $[0]$, i.e.Â an elliptic curve.
            -   Has a topological group structure!
        -   Genus $\geq 2$: Complicated?

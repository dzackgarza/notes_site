-   The scalar curvature represents the amount by which the volume of a small geodesic ball in a Riemannian manifold deviates from that of the standard ball in Euclidean space. In two dimensions, the scalar curvature is twice the [Gaussian%20curvature](Gaussian%20curvature)
-   Defined as the metric trace of the [[Ricci%20curvature.md | Ricci%20curvature.html]]: `

    \begin{align*}
    S = {\mathrm{tr}}_g \operatorname{Ric}

-   Can be expressed in terms of [Christoffel%20symbols](Christoffel%20symbols).
-   Requires a [[metric.md | metric.html]] $g$.
-   Big question: which smooth closed manifolds have metrics with positive scalar curvature?
    -   A lot is known!
    -   Gromov and Lawson: every simply connected [[metric.md | metric.html]] with positive scalar curvature.
        -   Uses an $\alpha$ invariant taking values in ${\mathsf{K}}O_n$
            -   See [[alpha%20invariant.md | alpha%20invariant.html]].
    -   Dimensions 3 and 4: as a cconsequence of [[aspherical%20space.md | aspherical%20space.html]] 3-manifolds and copies of $S^2 \times S^1$.
    -   In dimension 4, positive scalar curvature has stronger implications than in higher dimensions using [[Seiberg--Witten%20invariants.md | Seiberg–Witten%20invariants.html]]
        -   If $X$ is a compact [[Kähler.md) manifold of complex dimension 2 which is not rational or ruled, then X (as a smooth 4-manifold | Kähler.html]]%20manifold%20of%20complex%20dimension%202%20which%20is%20not%20rational%20or%20ruled,%20then%20X%20(as%20a%20smooth%204-manifold) has no Riemannian metric with positive scalar curvature.\[8\]

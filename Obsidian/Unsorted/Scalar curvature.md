-   The scalar curvature represents the amount by which the volume of a small geodesic ball in a Riemannian manifold deviates from that of the standard ball in Euclidean space. In two dimensions, the scalar curvature is twice the \[\[Gaussian curvature\]\]
-   Defined as the metric trace of the \[\[Ricci curvature\]\]: `
    <span class="math display">
    \begin{align*}
    S = {\mathrm{tr}}_g \operatorname{Ric}
    \end{align*}
    <span>`{=html}
-   Can be expressed in terms of \[\[Christoffel symbols\]\].
-   Requires a \[\[metric\]\] $g$.
-   Big question: which smooth closed manifolds have metrics with positive scalar curvature?
    -   A lot is known!
    -   Gromov and Lawson: every simply connected \[\[metric\]\] with positive scalar curvature.
        -   Uses an $\alpha$ invariant taking values in ${\mathsf{K}}O_n$
            -   See \[\[alpha invariant\]\].
    -   Dimensions 3 and 4: as a cconsequence of \[\[aspherical space\]\] 3-manifolds and copies of $S^2 \times S^1$.
    -   In dimension 4, positive scalar curvature has stronger implications than in higher dimensions using \[\[Seiberg--Witten invariants\]\]
        -   If $X$ is a compact \[\[Unsorted/Kahler\]\]manifold of complex dimension 2 which is not rational or ruled, then X (as a smooth 4-manifold) has no \[\[Riemannian metric\]\] with positive scalar curvature.\[8\]

Such 'stacky' objects can behave like smooth objects even if the underlying spaces have singularities. As for spaces, manifolds, and [[K-Theory.md | K-Theory.html]] lend themselves to generalization.

Special cases of orbifolds are 'global quotients', often denoted $M/G$, for example for a smooth action of a compact [[Lie%20group.md | Lie%20group.html]] $G$ on a smooth manifold $M$. In such examples, the orbifold cohomology of $M/G$ is supposed to be the $G$-equivariant cohomology of $M$.

This suggests away to do orbifold cohomology theories by means of [equivariant%20homology](equivariant%20homology) for all groups $G$, with some compatibility.

[Global%20homotopy%20theory](Global%20homotopy%20theory) makes this idea precise.

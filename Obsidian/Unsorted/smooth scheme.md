If $X\in {\mathsf{Sch}}({\mathrm{ft}})$ then there is a closed immersion $X\hookrightarrow{\mathbb{A}}^N_{/k}$ and $X = V(f_1, \cdots, f_m)$ for some $f_i\in k[[x_1, \cdots, x_{N}]$ . Then $X$ is **smooth of dimension $n$** iff - There exist neighborhoods of each point $U_x\ni x$ with $\dim U_x \geq n$, and - $\operatorname{rank}Df \geq N-n$ everywhere, where $Df = {\left[ { {\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}\,}} \right]}$ is the matrix of partial derivatives. - Equivalently, the dimension of the [Zariski%20tangent%20space.md | Zariski%20tangent%20space.html]] at every point is *equal* to $n$. - At singular points, the dimension of the tangent space *increases*.\

Recall that if $X$ and $S$ are smooth, then $\pi : X \to S$ is smooth if and only the differential is everywhere surjective.

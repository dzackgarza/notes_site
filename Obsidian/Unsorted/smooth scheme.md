If $X\in \Sch(\ft)$ then there is a closed immersion $X\injects \AA^N_{/k}$ and $X = V(f_1, \cdots, f_m)$ for some $f_i\in \kx{N}$ . Then $X$ is **smooth of dimension $n$** iff 
	- There exist neighborhoods of each point $U_x\ni x$ with $\dim U_x \geq n$, and
	- $\rank Df \geq N-n$ everywhere, where $Df = \tv{ \dd{f_i}{x_j}}$ is the matrix of partial derivatives.
	- Equivalently, the dimension of the [Zariski%20tangent%20space.md](Zariski%20tangent%20space.md) at every point is *equal* to $n$.
	- At singular points, the dimension of the tangent space *increases*.\
	

Recall that if $X$ and $S$ are smooth, then $\pi : X \to  S$ is smooth if and only the differential is everywhere surjective.

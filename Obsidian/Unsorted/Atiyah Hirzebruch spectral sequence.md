From Arun:

> Atiyah and Hirzebruch is good but quite telegraphic, and the AHSS just ... isn't discussed in McCleary's book Maunder, "The spectral sequence of an extraordinary cohomology theory" might be one such reference; for example, it shows the first nonzero differential is a [k-invariant](k-invariant) k-invariants are often written very confusingly; for example, for KU, Atiyah-Hirzebruch write $\operatorname{Sq}_3$, which you're supposed to know means reduce mod 2, do $\operatorname{Sq}^2$, then take the integral [Bockstein](Bockstein)

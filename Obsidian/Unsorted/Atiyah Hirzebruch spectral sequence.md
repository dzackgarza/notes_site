- Relates $\EE^i(X)$ a cohomology theory to $H^i_\sing$:
$$
E^2_{p, q} = H^p(B; \EE^qF) \abuts \EE^{p+q}X
$$

From Arun:

> Atiyah and Hirzebruch is good but quite telegraphic, and the AHSS just ... isn't discussed in McCleary's book 
> Maunder, "The spectral sequence of an extraordinary cohomology theory" might be one such reference; for example, it shows the first nonzero differential is a [k-invariant](k-invariant)
> k-invariants are often written very confusingly; for example, for KU, Atiyah-Hirzebruch write $\Sq_3$, which you're supposed to know means reduce mod 2, do $\Sq^2$, then take the integral [Bockstein](Bockstein)

- Can define parallel vector fields as $\nabla X = 0$, a PDE.
	- Don't generally exist, this is an overdetermined equation.
	The integrability condition for this equation is equivalent to $\Curv(\nabla) = 0$.
	- If curvature vanishes, parallel transport along every curve can be used to define parallel vector fields on $M$.

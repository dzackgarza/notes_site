-   Can define parallel vector fields as $\nabla X = 0$, a PDE.
    -   Don't generally exist, this is an overdetermined equation. The integrability condition for this equation is equivalent to $\mathop{\mathrm{Curv}}(\nabla) = 0$.
    -   If curvature vanishes, parallel transport along every curve can be used to define parallel vector fields on $M$.

-   A $G{\hbox{-}}$torsor is a set with a free transitive $G{\hbox{-}}$action. For example, the fibers of a [[principal%20bundle.md | principal%20bundle.html]] are torsors. Given any two torsors, we can compare them using elements of $G$, but there is no distinguished element. For example, ${\mathbb{A}}_n$ is a torsor over the vector space $k^n$.

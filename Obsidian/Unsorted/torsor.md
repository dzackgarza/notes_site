-  A $G\dash$torsor is a set with a free transitive $G\dash$action.
For example, the fibers of a [principal%20bundle.md](principal%20bundle.md) are torsors.
Given any two torsors, we can compare them using elements of $G$, but there is no distinguished element.
For example, $\AA_n$ is a torsor over the vector space $k^n$.

For $R$ a local ring, $\operatorname{Spec}R$ has a **generic point** $(0)$ and a **special point** or **closed point** corresponding to the maximal ideal ${\mathfrak{m}}$. Then for a morphism $X\to \operatorname{Spec}R$, the **generic fiber** is the fiber above $(0)$ and the **special fiber** is the fiber above ${\mathfrak{m}}$.

Comes up in the theory of **degeneration**: how does one pass from the generic fiber to the special fiber? This corresponds to "specializing" parameters somehow?

A profinite group is a topological group that is isomorphic to the inverse limit of discrete finite groups.[

Examples:

- The [p-adic%20integers.md](p-adic%20integers.md) 
- The [profinite%20integers.md](profinite%20integers.md)

Profinite completions

Given $G\in \Grp$ a related profinite group $\hat{G} \in \Grp$, the profinite completion of G. It is defined as
$$
\hat G := \inverselim_{\substack{ N\normal G \\ [G:N] < \infty }} G/N
,$$ 
where $N$ runs through the normal subgroups in G of finite index

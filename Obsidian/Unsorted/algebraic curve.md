# Notes

-   Encode points on a smooth projective curve as valuations measuring orders of poles/zeros.
    -   Bounded valuations: points on the variety
    -   Unbounded: points "at infinity", like puncture points on a Riemann surface
-   Compactifications are not unique. Example:
    -   ${\mathbb{A}}^2 \subseteq {\mathbb{P}}^2$
    -   ${\mathbb{A}}^2 \subseteq ({\mathbb{P}}^1)^{\times 2}$
    -   But ${\mathbb{P}}^2 \neq ({\mathbb{P}}^1)^{\times 2}$!

The algebraic analogues of a compact [[proper.md | proper.html]] complex algebraic curve of genus $g$.

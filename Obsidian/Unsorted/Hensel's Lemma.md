-   Slogan: If a polynomial $p(x)$ has a [simple%20root) $r$ modulo a prime $p$, then $r$ corresponds to a unique root of \$p(x](simple%20root)%20%20$r$%20modulo%20a%20prime%20$p$,%20then%20$r$%20corresponds%20to%20a%20unique%20root%20of%20$p(x)$ modulo any $p^n$ gotten by iteratively "lifting" solutions.
-   Setup: let $K\in \mathsf{Field}$ be [residue%20field](residue%20field).
    -   $K$ is **Henselian** if $p \in {\mathcal{O}}_K[x]$ where its reduction $\mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mup\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu \in \kappa(k)[x]$ has a simple root $k_0$, there is a lift $\tilde k_0 \in {\mathcal{O}}_K$ with $p(\tilde k_0) = 0$.
-   A [local%20ring](local%20ring) $R$ with maximal ideal ${\mathfrak{m}}$ is called **Henselian** if Hensel's lemma holds.
    -   This means that if $p\in R[x]$ is monic, then any factorization of its image $\mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mup\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu \in (R/{\mathfrak{m}})[x]$ into a product of coprime monic polynomials can be lifted to a factorization of $p$ in $R[x]$.
-   A field with [valuation%20ring](valuation%20ring) is Henselian.
-   A Henselian local ring is called **strictly Henselian** if its residue field is [separably%20closed](separably%20closed).
-   The Henselization of A is an algebraic substitute for the completion of A
-   See slogan: Henselian implies large. Can product points.

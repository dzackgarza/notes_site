-  Notation: $\Ahat(M)$. Defined as the multiplicative sequence genus of the power series
$$
\frac{\sqrt{z} / 2}{\sinh (\sqrt{z} / 2)}=1-\frac{z}{24}+\frac{7 z^{2}}{5760}-\cdots
$$
- Genus: like a ring homomorphism $g: \K _0(X, \coprod, \times) \to (\ZZ, +, \cdot)$ for $X$ a manifold with boundary up to [cobordism.md), where $g(X](cobordism.md),%20where%20$g(X) = 0 \iff X = \bd X'$.
-  In $\ZZ$ for [spin.md](spin.md) manifolds, and is *even* if additionally $\dim_\RR M = 4 \mod 8$
-  The [Aatiyah-Singer%20Index%20Theorem.md) implies that $\Ahat(M) = \Ind(\dirac](Aatiyah-Singer%20Index%20Theorem.md)%20implies%20that%20$/Ahat(M)%20=%20/Ind(/dirac)$ for spin manifolds

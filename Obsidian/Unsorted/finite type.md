A morphism $f \in \Sch(X, Y)$ is **locally of finite type** if $Y$ may be covered by affine opens $\spec B_i$ such that each $\exists \spec A_i \covers f\inv (\spec B_i)$ with each $\spec A_i \in X$ and $A_i \in \Alg_{/B}^\fg$.

$f$ is **finite type** if $Y$ can be covered by affine opens such that each $f\inv(\spec B_i)$ can be covered by *finitely* many $\spec A_i$ as above.

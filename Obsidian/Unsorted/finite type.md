A morphism $f \in {\mathsf{Sch}}(X, Y)$ is **locally of finite type** if $Y$ may be covered by affine opens $\operatorname{Spec}B_i$ such that each $\exists \operatorname{Spec}A_i \rightrightarrows f^{-1}(\operatorname{Spec}B_i)$ with each $\operatorname{Spec}A_i \in X$ and $A_i \in {\mathsf{Alg}}_{/B}^{\mathrm{fg}}$.

$f$ is **finite type** if $Y$ can be covered by affine opens such that each $f^{-1}(\operatorname{Spec}B_i)$ can be covered by *finitely* many $\operatorname{Spec}A_i$ as above.

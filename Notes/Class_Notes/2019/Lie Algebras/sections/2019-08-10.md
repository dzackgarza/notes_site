# Foreword

These are notes from Chun-Ju (CJ) Lai's Fall 2019 course on Lie Algebras at the University of Georgia.
It is worth noting that they were live-tex'd, and thus any errors or inaccuracies are certainly due to my own mistakes and/or lack of understanding.
For those that do spot errors and would like to help improve these notes, please feel free to email me directly or submit a pull request to [the Github repository](https://github.com/dzackgarza/UGA_Lie_Algebras_Fall_2019).

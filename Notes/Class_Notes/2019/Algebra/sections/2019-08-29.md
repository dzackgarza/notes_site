## Classification of Groups of Certain Orders

We have a classification of some finite abelian groups.

| Order of G 	| Number of Groups 	| List of Distinct Groups                    	|
|------------	|------------------	|--------------------------------------------	|
| 1          	| 1                	| $\theset{e}$                               	|
| 2          	| 1                	| $\ZZ_2$                                    	|
| 3          	| 1                	| $\ZZ_3$                                    	|
| 4          	| 2                	| $\ZZ_4, \ZZ_2^2$                           	|
| 5          	| 1                	| $\ZZ_5$                                    	|
| 6          	| 2                	| $\ZZ_6, S_3$ (*)                           	|
| 7          	| 1                	| $\ZZ_7$                                    	|
| 8          	| 5                	| $\ZZ_8,\ZZ_4 \cross \ZZ_2, \ZZ_2^3, D_4, Q$ |
| 9          	| 2                	| $\ZZ_9, \ZZ_3^2$                           	|
| 10         	| 2                	| $\ZZ_{10}, D_5$                            	|
| 11         	| 1                	| $\ZZ_{11}$                                 	|

*Exercise*: show that groups of order $p^2$ are abelian.

We still need to justify $S_3, D_4, Q, D_5$.

Recall that for any group $A$, we can consider the free group on the elements of $A$ given by $F[A]$.

> Note that we can also restrict $A$ to just its generators.

There is then a homomorphism $F[A] \to A$, where the kernel is the relations.

*Example:*
$$
\ZZ \ast \ZZ = \generators{x, y \mid xyx\inv y\inv = e} \text{ where } x = (1, 0),~ y = (0, 1)
.$$


## Groups of Order 6

Let $G$ be nonabelian of order $6$.

> Idea: look at subgroups of index 2.

Let $P$ be a Sylow 3-subgroup of $G$, then $r_3 = 1$ so $P\normal G$.
Moreover, $P$ is cyclic since it is order 3, so $P = \generators{a}$.

But since $\abs{G/P} = 2$, it is also cyclic, so $G/P = \generators{bP}$.

Note that $b\not\in P$, but $b^2 \in P$ since $(bP)^2 = P$, so $b^2 \in \theset{e, a, a^2}$.

If $b=a, a^2$ then $b$ has order 6, but this would make $G = \generators{b}$ cyclic and thus abelian.
So $b^2=1$.

Since $P \normal G$, we have $bPb\inv = P$, and in particular $bab\inv$ has order 3.

So either $bab\inv = a$, or $bab\inv = a^2$.
If $bab\inv = a$, then $G$ is abelian, so $bab\inv = a^2$.
So
$$
G = \generators{a, b \mid a^3 = e, b^2 = e, bab\inv = a^2}
.$$

We've shown that *if* there is such a nonabelian group, then it must satisfy these relations -- we still need to produce some group that actually realizes this.

Consider the symmetries of the triangle:

You can check that $a,b$ satisfy the appropriate relations.

## Groups of Order 10

For order 10, a similar argument yields

$$
G = \generators{a, b \mid a^5 = 1, b^2 = 1, ba=a^4b}
,$$
and this is realized by symmetries of the pentagon where $a = (1~2~3~4~5), b=(1~4)(2~3)$.

## Groups of Order 8

Assume $G$ is nonabelian of order 8.
$G$ has no elements of order 8, so the only possibilities for orders of elements are 1, 2, or 4.

Assume all elements have order 1 or 2.
Let $a,b\in G$, consider
$$
(ab)^2 = abab \implies ab=b\inv a\inv = ba
,$$
and thus $G$ is abelian.
So there must be an element of order 4.

So suppose $a\in G$ has order 4, which is an index 2 subgroup, and so $\generators{a} \normal G$.

But $\abs{G/\generators a} = 2$ is cyclic, so $G/\generators a = \generators{bH}$.

> Note that $b^2 \in H = \generators a$.

If $b^2=a, a^3$ then $b$ will have order 8, making $G$ cyclic.
So $b^2 = 1, a^2$. These are both valid possibilities.

Since $H \normal G$, we have $b\generators a b\inv = \generators a$, and since $a$ has order 4, so does $bab\inv$.

So $bab\inv = a, a^3$, but $a$ is not an option because this would make $G$ abelian.

So we have two options:

\begin{align*}
G_1 &= \generators{a, b \mid a^4 = 1, b^2=1, bab\inv = a^3} \\
G_2 &= \generators{a, b \mid a^4 = 1, b^2 = a^2, bab\inv = a^3}
.\end{align*}

*Exercise*: prove $G_1 \not\cong G_2$.

Now to realize these groups:

- $G_1$ is the group of symmetries of the square, where $a = (1~2~3~4), b=(1~3)$.

- $G_2 \cong Q$, the quaternions, where $Q = \theset{\pm 1,\pm i, \pm j, \pm k}$, and there are relations (add picture here).

## Some Nice Facts

- If and $\phi: G\to G'$, then
  - $N \normal G \implies N \normal \phi(G)$, although it is not necessarily normal in $G$.
  - $N' \normal G' \implies \phi\inv(N') \normal G$

**Definition**:
A *maximal normal subgroup* is a normal subgroup $M \normal G$ that is properly contained in $G$, and if $M \leq N \normal G$ (where $N$ is proper) then $M = N$.

**Theorem:**
$M$ is a maximal normal subgroup of $G$ iff $G/M$ is simple.

## Simple Groups

**Definition**:
A group $G$ is simple iff $N \normal G \implies N = \theset e, G$.

Note that if an abelian group has *any* subgroups, then it is not simple, so $G = \ZZ_p$ is the only simple abelian group.
Another example of a simple group is $A_n$ for $n\geq 5$.

**Theorem (Feit-Thompson, 1964):**
Every finite nonabelian simple group has even order.

> Note that this is a consequence of the "odd order theorem".

## Series of Groups

A composition series is a descending series of pairwise normal subgroups such that each successive quotient is simple:

\begin{align*}
G_0 \normal G_1 \normal G_2 \cdots \normal \theset e \\
G_i/G_{i+1}~\text{ simple}
.\end{align*}

*Example:*

\begin{align*}
\ZZ_9 \normal \ZZ_3 \normal \theset e \\
\ZZ_9 / \ZZ_3 = \ZZ_3,\\
\ZZ_3 / \theset e = \ZZ_3
.\end{align*}

*Example:*

\begin{align*}
\ZZ_6 \normal \ZZ_3 \normal \theset e \\
\ZZ_6 / \ZZ_3 = \ZZ_2 \\
\ZZ_2 / \theset e = \ZZ_2
.\end{align*}

but also

\begin{align*}
\ZZ_6 \normal \ZZ_2 \normal \theset e \\
\ZZ_6 / \ZZ_2 = \ZZ_3 \\
\ZZ_3 / \theset e = \ZZ_3
.\end{align*}

**Theorem (Jordan-Holder):**
Any two composition series are "isomorphic" in the sense that the same quotients appear in both series, up to a permutation.

**Definition:**
A group is *solvable* iff it has a composition series where all factors are abelian.

*Exercise*:
Show that any abelian group is solvable.

*Example:*
$S_n$ is *not* solvable for $n\geq 5$, since

\begin{align*}
S_n &\normal A_n \normal \theset e \\
S_n / A_n &= \ZZ_2~\text{simple} \\
A_n / \theset{e} &= A_n~\text{simple} \iff n\geq 5
.\end{align*}

*Example:*

\begin{align*}
S_4 &\normal A_4 \normal G \normal \theset e \quad \text{where } \abs H = 4 \\
S_4 / A_4 &= \ZZ_2 \\
A_4 / H &= \ZZ_3 \\
H / \theset e &= \theset{a, b}?
.\end{align*}

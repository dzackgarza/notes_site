# Dictionary of Interpretations

When doing combinatorial problems, it's often useful to have a "dictionary" in mind: some go-to interpretations of what any given combinatorial quantity might signify.
These are particularly useful when you'd like to prove identities by counting both sides in different ways.

\begin{align*}
n! &\qquad \text{Strings of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $n$ with no duplicates,}\\
&\qquad \text{Ways to arrange $n$ distinct objects in a line, or}\\
&\qquad \text{Number of functions $[n] \to [n]$ that are injective and surjective}\\
&\qquad \text{Ways to place $n$ labeled balls into $n$ labeled bins, each bin has $\leq 1$ ball}\\
n^{\underline k} = n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1) &\qquad \text{Strings of length $k$ over an alphabet of size $n$ with no duplicates, or} \\
&\qquad \text{}\\
\end{align*}

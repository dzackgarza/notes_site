Recall the Harish-Chandra morphism $\xi$:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\mcz(\lieg) \arrow[rr, hook] \arrow[rrdd, "\xi", dashed] &  & U(\lieg) = U(\lieh) \oplus (\lien^- U(\lieg) + U(\lieg)\lien) \arrow[dd, "\mathrm{pr}"] \\
&  &                                                                               \\
&  & U(\lieh)                                                                     
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

If $M$ is a highest weight module of highest weight $\lambda$ then $z\in \mcz(\lieg)$ acts on $M$ by scalar multiplication.
Note that if we have $\chi_\lambda(z)$ where $z\cdot v = \chi_\lambda(z) v$ for all $v\in M$, we can identify $\lambda(\mathrm{pr}(z)) = \lambda(\xi(z))$.

## Central Characters and Linkage

The $\chi_\lambda$ are not all distinct -- for example, if $M(\mu) \subset M(\lambda)$, then $\chi_\mu = \chi_\lambda$.
More generally, if $L(\mu)$ is a subquotient of $M(\lambda)$ then $\chi_\mu = \chi_\lambda$.
So when do we have equality $\chi_\mu = \chi_\lambda$?

Given $\lieg \supset \lieh$ with $\Phi \supset \Phi^+ \supset \Delta$, then define $$\rho = \frac 1 2 \sum_{\beta \in \Phi^+} \beta \in \lieh\dual.$$
Note that $\alpha \in \Delta \implies s_\alpha \rho = \rho - \alpha$.

Definition (Dot Action)
:   The *dot action* of $W$ on $\lieh\dual$ is given by $$w\cdot \lambda = w(\lambda + \rho) - \rho,$$ which implies $(\rho, \alpha\dual) = 1$ for all $\alpha \in \Delta$.
    Then $\rho = \sum_{i=1}^\ell w$.

Exercise 
:   Check that this gives a well-defined group action.

Definition (Linkage Class)
:   $\mu$ is *linked* to $\lambda$ iff $\mu = w\cdot \lambda$ for some $w\in W$.
Note that this is an equivalence relation, with equivalence classes/orbits where the orbit of $\lambda$ is $\theset{w\cdot \lambda \suchthat w\in W}$ is called the *linkage class* of $\lambda$.

Note that this is a finite subset, since $W$ is finite.
Orbit-stabilizer applies here, so bigger stabilizers yield smaller orbits and vice-versa.

Example
:   $w\cdot (-\rho) = w(-\rho + \rho) - \rho = -\rho$, so $-\rho$ is in its own linkage class.

Definition (Dot-Regular)
:   $\lambda \in \lieh\dual$ is *dot-regular* iff $\abs{W\cdot \lambda } = \abs{W}$, or equivalently if $(\lambda + \rho, \beta\dual) \neq 0$ for all $\beta \in \Phi$.

To think about: does this hold if $\Phi$ is replaced by $\Delta$?

We also say $\lambda$ is *dot-singular* if $\lambda$ is not dot-regular, or equivalently $\stab_{W\cdot}\lambda \neq \theset{1}$.

> I.e. lying on root hyperplanes.

Exercise
:   If $0\in \lieh\dual$ is regular, then $-\rho$ is singular.

Proposition (Weights in Weyl Orbit Yield Equal Characters)
: If $\lambda \in \Lambda$ and $\mu \in W\cdot \lambda$, then $\chi_\mu = \chi_\lambda$.

Proof
:   Start with $\alpha \in \Delta$ and consider $\mu = s_\alpha \cdot \lambda$.
    Since $\lambda \in \Lambda$, we have $n\definedas (\lambda ,\alpha\dual) \in \ZZ$ by definition.
    There are three cases:

    1. $n\in \ZZ^+$, then $M(s_\alpha \cdot \lambda) \subset M(\lambda)$.
      By Proposition 1.4, we have $\chi_\mu =\chi_\lambda$.

    2. For $n=-1$, $\mu = s_\alpha \cdot \lambda = \lambda + \rho -(\lambda + \rho, \alpha\dual)\alpha - \rho = \lambda + n+1 = \lambda + 0$.
      So $\mu = \lambda$ and thus $M_\mu = M_\lambda$.

    3. For $n\leq -2$, 

    \begin{align*}
    (\mu, \alpha\dual) 
    &= (s_\alpha \cdot \lambda , \alpha\dual) \\
    &= (\lambda i (n+1)\alpha, \alpha\dual) \\
    &= n - 2(n+1) \\
    &= -n-2 \\
    &\geq 0
    ,\end{align*}
  
    so $\chi_\mu = \chi_{s_\alpha \cdot \mu} = \chi_{s\alpha \cdot (s_\alpha \cdot \lambda)} = \chi_\lambda$.
    Since $W$ is generated by simple reflections and the linkage property is transitive, the result follows by induction on $\ell(w)$.

Exercise (1.8)
:   See book, show that certain properties of the dot action hold (namely nonlinearity).

## 1.9: Extending the Harish-Chandra Morphism

We want to extend the previous proposition from $\lambda \in \Lambda$ to $\lambda \in \lieh\dual$.
We'll use a density argument from affine algebraic geometry, and switch to the Zariski topology on $\lieh\dual \subset \CC^n$.

Fix a basis $\Delta = \theset{a_1, \cdots, a_\ell}$ and use the Killing form to identify these with a basis for $\lieh = \theset{h_1, \cdots, h_\ell}$.
Similarly, take $\theset{w_1, \cdots, w_\ell}$ as a basis for $\lieh\dual$, and we'll use the identification

\begin{align*}
\lieh\dual &\iff \AA^\ell \\
\lambda &\iff (\lambda(h_1), \cdots, \lambda(h_\ell))
.\end{align*}

We identify $U(\lieh) = S(\lieh) = \CC[h_1, \cdots, h_\ell]$ with $P(\lieh\dual)$ which are polynomial functions on $\lieh\dual$.
Fix $\lambda \in \lieh\dual$, extended $\lambda$ to be a multiplicative function on polynomials.
For $f\in \CC[h_1, \cdots, h_\ell]$, we defined $\lambda(f)$.
Under the identification, we send this to $\tilde f$ where $\tilde f(\lambda) = \lambda(f)$.

> Note: we'll identify $f$ and $\tilde f$ notationally going forward and drop the tilde everywhere.

Then $W$ acts on $P(\lieh\dual)$ by the dot action: $(w\cdot \tilde f)(\lambda) = \tilde f(w\inv \cdot \lambda)$.

Exercise
: Check that this is a well-defined action.

Under this identification, we have

\begin{align*}
\lieh\dual &\iff \AA^\ell \\
\Lambda &\iff \ZZ^\ell
.\end{align*}

Note that $\Lambda$ is discrete in the analytic topology, but is *dense* in the Zariski topology.

Proposition (Polynomials Vanishing on a Lattice Are Zero)
:   A polynomial $f$ on $\AA^\ell$ vanishing on $\ZZ^\ell$ must be identically zero.

Proof
:   For $\ell = 1$: 
    A nonzero polynomial in one variable has only finitely many zeros, but if $f$ vanishes on $\ZZ$ it has infinitely many zeros.

    For $\ell > 1$:
    View $f\in \CC[h_1, \cdots, h_{\ell-1}][h_\ell]$.
    Substituting any fixed integers for the $h_i$ for $i\leq \ell - 1$ yields a polynomial in one variable which vanishes on $\ZZ$.
    By the first case, $f \equiv 0$, so the coefficients must all be zero and the coefficient polynomials in $\CC[h_1, \cdots ,h_{\ell-1}]$ vanish on $\ZZ^{\ell-1}$.
    By induction, these coefficient polynomials are identically zero.

Corollary (Lattices Are Zariski-Dense in Affine Space)
:   The only Zariski-closed subset of $\AA^\ell$ containing $\ZZ^\ell$ is $\AA^\ell$ itself, so the Zariski closure $\bar{\ZZ^\ell} = \AA^\ell$ and $\ZZ^\ell$ is dense in $\AA^\ell$.

# Obstruction and Deformation (Tuesday February 25th)

Let $k$ be a field, $X_{_{/k}}$ projective, then the $k\dash$points $\hilb_{X_{_{/k}}}^P(k)$ corresponds to closed subschemes $Z\subset X$ with hilbert polynomial $P_z = P$.
Given a $P$, we want to understand the local structure of $\hilb_{X_{_{/k}}}^p$, i.e. diagrams of the form


\begin{tikzcd}
                                        &  &                                               &  & \hilb_{X_{_{/k}}}^P \arrow[dd] \\
                                        &  &                                               &  &                          \\
\spec(k) \arrow[rrrruu, "p"] \arrow[rr] &  & \spec(A) \arrow[rruu, "?", dashed] \arrow[rr] &  & \spec(k)                 \\
                                        &  &                                               &  &                          \\
                                        &  & A_{/k} \text{ Artinian local} \arrow[uu]         &  &
\end{tikzcd}



:::{.example title="?"}
For $A = k[\eps]$, the set of extensions is the Zariski tangent space.
:::
  

  
:::{.definition title="Category of Artinian Algebras"}
Let $(\Art_{/k})$ be the category of local Artinian $k\dash$algebras with local residue field $k$.
:::

Note that these will be the types of algebras appearing in the above diagrams.


:::{.remark}
This category has fiber coproducts, i.e. there are pushouts:


\begin{tikzcd}
C \arrow[dd] \arrow[rr] &  & A \arrow[dd, dashed] \\
                        &  &                      \\
B \arrow[rr, dashed]    &  & A \tensor_C B
\end{tikzcd}


There are also fibered products,


\begin{tikzcd}
A \cross_C B \arrow[rr, dashed] \arrow[dd, dashed] &  & B \arrow[dd] \\
                                                  &  &              \\
A \arrow[rr]                                       &  & C
\end{tikzcd}


Here, $A \cross_C B \definedas \theset{(a, b) \suchthat f(a) = g(b)} \subset A\cross B$.

:::
    


:::{.example title="?"}
If $A = B = k[\eps]/(\eps^2)$ and $C = k$, then $A\cross_C B = k[\eps_1, \eps_2]/(\eps_1, \eps_2)^2$

Note that on the $\spec$ side, these should be viewed as
$$
\spec(A) \disjoint_{\spec(C)} \spec(B) = \spec(A\cross_C B)
.$$

:::{.definition title="Deformation Functor (Preliminary Definition)"}
A *deformation functor* is a functor $F: (\Art_{/k}) \to \Set$ such that $F(k) = \pt$ is a singleton.
:::



:::{.example title="?"}
Let $X_{_{/k}}$ be any scheme and let $x\in X(k)$ be a $k\dash$point.
We can consider the deformation functor $F$ such that $F(A)$ is the set of extensions $f$ of the following form:


\begin{tikzcd}
                                          &  &                                               &  & X \arrow[dd] \\
                                          &  &                                               &  &              \\
\spec(k) \arrow[rrrruu, "x"] \arrow[rr, hook] &  & \spec(A) \arrow[rruu, "f", dashed] \arrow[rr] &  & \spec(k)
\end{tikzcd}


If $A' \to A$ is a morphism, then we define $F(A') \to F(A)$ is defined because we can precompose to fill in the following diagram


\begin{tikzcd}
                                    &  &                                                            &  &                                                       &  &  &  & X \arrow[ddd] \\
                                    &  &                                                            &  &                                                       &  &  &  &               \\
                                    &  &                                                            &  &                                                       &  &  &  &               \\
\spec(k) \arrow[rrd] \arrow[rrrrrrrruuu] &  &                                                            &  &                                                       &  &  &  & \spec(k)      \\
                                    &  & \spec(A) \arrow[rr] \arrow[rrrrrruuuu, "\exists \tilde f"] &  & \spec(A') \arrow[rrrru] \arrow[rrrruuuu, "f", dashed] &  &  &  &
\end{tikzcd}



So this is indeed a deformation functor.
:::


:::{.example title="a motivating example"}
The Zariski tangent space on the nodal cubic doesn't "see" the two branches, so we allow "second order" tangent vectors.
:::

We can consider parametrizing the functors above as $F_{X, x}(A)$, which is isomorphic to $F_{\spec (\OO_x)_{X, x}}$ and further isomorphic to $F_{\spec \hat{\OO_x}_{x, X} }$.
This is because for Artinian algebras, we have maps
$$
\spec (\OO_{x, X})/\mfm^N \to \spec \OO_{X, x} \to X
.$$



:::{.remark}
$\hat{ \OO }_{X, x}$ will be determined by $F_{X, x}$.
:::
  


:::{.example title="?"}
Consider $y^2 = x^2(x+1)$, and think about solving this over $k[t]/t^n$ with solutions equivalent to $(0, 0) \mod t$.

![Image](figures/2020-02-25-13:20.png)\

Note that the 'second order' tangent vector comes from $\spec k[t]/t^3$.

We can write $F_{X, x}(A) = \pi\inv(x)$ where
$$
\hom_{\Sch_{/k}}(\spec k, X) \mapsvia{\pi} \hom_{\Sch_{/k}}(\spec k, x) \ni x
.$$
Thus
$$
F_{X, x}(A) = \hom_{\Sch_{/k}}(\spec A, \spec \OO_{x, X}) = \hom_{k\dash\alg}(\hat \OO_{X, x}, A)
.$$
:::


:::{.example title="?"}
Given any local $k\dash$algebra $R$, we can consider

\[
h_R: (\Art_{/k}) &\to \Set \\
A &\mapsto \hom(R, A)
.\]

and

\[
h_{\spec R}: (\Art\Sch_{/k})\op \to \Set \\
\spec(A) &\mapsto \hom(\spec A, \spec R)
.\]
:::


:::{.definition title="Representable Deformation"}
A deformation $F$ is **representable** if it is of the form $h_R$ as above for some $R \in \Art_{/k}$.
:::


:::{.remark}
There is a Yoneda Lemma for $A\in \Art_{/k}$,
\[
\hom_{\mathrm{Fun}}(h_A, F) = F(A)
.\]

We are thus looking for things that are representable in a larger category, which restrict.

:::


:::{.definition title="Pro-Representability"}
A deformation functor is *pro-representable* if it is of the form $h_R$ for $R$ a complete local $k\dash$algebra (i.e. a limit of Artinian local $k\dash$algebras).
:::


:::{.remark}
We will see that there are simple criteria for a deformation functor to be pro-representable.
This will eventually give us the complete local ring, which will give us the scheme representing the functor we want.
:::



:::{.remark}
It is difficult to understand even $F_{X, x}(A)$ directly, but it's easier to understand small extensions.
:::
  

  
:::{.definition title="Small Extensions"}
A *small extension* is a SES of Artinian $k\dash$algebras of the form
\[
0 \to J \to A' \to A \to 0
.\]
such that $J$ is annihilated by the maximal ideal fo $A'$.
:::


:::{.lemma title="?"}
Given any quotient $B\to A \to 0$ of Artinian $k\dash$algebras, there is a sequence of small extensions (quotients):


\begin{tikzcd}
0                                          &  &                  &  &        &  &                          \\
                                        &  &                  &  &        &  &                          \\
B_0 \arrow[uu]                             &  & B_1 \arrow[lluu] &  & \cdots &  & B_n = A \arrow[lllllluu] \\
                                        &  &                  &  &        &  &                          \\
B \arrow[uu] \arrow[rruu] \arrow[rrrrrruu] &  &                  &  &        &  &
\end{tikzcd}




This yields


\begin{tikzcd}
\spec A \arrow[rrrr, hook] \arrow[rrrrdddddd, Rightarrow] &  &  &  & \spec B                    \\
                                                        &  &  &  &                            \\
                                                        &  &  &  & \spec B_0 \arrow[uu, hook] \\
                                                        &  &  &  &                            \\
                                                        &  &  &  & \vdots \arrow[uu, hook]    \\
                                                        &  &  &  &                            \\
                                                        &  &  &  & \spec B_n \arrow[uu, hook]
\end{tikzcd}


where the $\spec B_i$ are all small.

:::{.remark}
In most cases, extending deformations over small extensions is easy.

## First Example of Deformation and Obstruction Spaces

Suppose $k=\bar k$ and let $X_{_{/k}}$ be connected.
We have a picard functor
\[
\pic_{X_{_{/k}}}: (\Sch_{/k})\op &\to \Set \\
S &\mapsto \pic(X_S) / \pic(S)
.\]
If we take a point $x\in \pic_{X_{_{/k}}}(k)$, which is equivalent to line bundles on $X$ up to equivalence, we obtain a deformation functor
\[
F \definedas F_{\pic_{ X_{_{/k}}, x  }} &\to \Set\\
A \mapsto \pi\inv(x)
\]
where
\[
\pi: \pic_{X_{_{/k}}}(\spec A) &\to \pic_{X_{_{/k}}} (\spec k) \\
\pi\inv(x) &\mapsto x
.\]

This is given by taking a line bundle on the thickening and restricting to a closed point.
Thus the functor is given by sending $A$ to the set of line bundles on $X_A$ which restrict to $X_x$.
That is, $F(A) \subset \pic_{X_{_{/k}}}(\spec A)$ which restrict to $x$.
So just pick the subspace $\pic(X_A)$ (base changing to $A$) which restrict.
There is a natural identification of $\pic(X_A) = H^1(X_A, \OO_{X_A}^*)$.
If
\[
0\to J \to A' \to A \to 0
.\]
is a thickening of Artinian $k\dash$algebras, there is a restriction map of invertible functions
\[
\OO_{X_A}^* \to \OO_{X_A'}^* \to 0
.\]
which is surjective since the map on structure sheaves is surjective and its a nilpotent extension.
The kernel is then just $\OO_{X_{A'}} \tensor J$.
If this is a small extension, we get a SES
\[
0 \to \OO_X \tensor J \to \OO_{X_{A'}}^* \to \OO_{x_A}^* \to 0
.\]
Taking the LES in cohomology, we obtain
\[
H^1 \OO_X \tensor J \to H^1 \OO_{X_{A'}}^* \to H^1\OO_{x_A}^* \to H^0 \OO_X \tensor J
.\]
Thus there is an obstruction class in $H^2$, and the ambiguity is detected by $H^1$.
Thus $H^1$ is referred to as the **deformation space**, since it counts the extensions, and $H^2$ is the **obstruction space**.

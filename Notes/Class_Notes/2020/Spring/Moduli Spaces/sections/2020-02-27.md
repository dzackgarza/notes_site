# Deformation Theory (Thursday February 27th)

Big picture idea:
We have moduli functors, such as

\[
F_{S'}: (\Sch_{/k})\op &\to \Set \\
\hilb: S &\to \text{flat subschemes of } X_S \\
\pic: S &\to \pic(X_S)/\pic(S) \\
\mathrm{Def}: S &\to \text{flat families } / S,~ \text{smooth, finite, of genus } g
.\]



:::{.definition title="Deformation Theory"}
Choose a point $f$ the scheme representing $F_{S'}$ with $\xi_0 \in F_{gl}(\spec K)$.
Define

\[
F_{\text{loc}}: (\text{Artinian local schemes} / K)\op \to \set
.\]


\begin{tikzcd}
\spec(K) \arrow[rr, "i", hook] &  & \spec(A) \arrow[rr] &  & F(i)\inv(\xi_0) \arrow[rr] &  & F_{gr}(\spec K) \arrow[dd, "F(i)"] \\
                               &  &                     &  &                            &  &                                    \\
                               &  &                     &  &                            &  & F_{gl}(\spec K)

:::{.definition title="Deformation Functors"}
Let $F: (\Art_{/k}) \to \Set$ where $F(k)$ is a point.
Denote $\hat{\Art}_{/k}$ the set of complete local $k\dash$algebras.
Since $\Art_{/k} \subset \hat{\Art} / k$, we can make extensions $\hat F$ by just taking limits:


\begin{tikzcd}
                                & \Art_{/k} \arrow[rrr, "F"]                         &  &  & \Set \\
                                &                                                 &  &  &      \\
\lim_{\from} R/\mfm_R^n = R \in & \hat{\Art}_{/k} \arrow[uu] \arrow[rrruu, "\hat F"] &  &  &
\end{tikzcd}


where we define 
\[
\hat{F}(R) \da \inverselim F(R/\mfm_R^n)
.\]
:::


:::{.question}
When is $F$ pro-representable, which happens iff $\hat F$ is representable?
In particular, we want $h_R \mapsvia{\cong} \hat F$ for $R\in \hat{\Art}_{/k}$, so
\[
h_R = \hom_{\hat{\Art}_{/k}}(R, \wait) = \hom_{?}(\wait, \spec k)
.\]
:::


:::{.example title="?"}
Let $F_{\text{gl}} = \hilb_{X_{_{/k}}}^p$, which is represented by $H_{/k}$.
Then .
\[
\xi_0 = F_{\text{gl}}(k) = H(k) = \theset{Z\subset X \suchthat P_z = f}
.\]
Then $F_{\text{loc} }$ is representable by $\hat \OO_{H/\xi_0}$.
:::


:::{.definition title="Thickening"}
Given an Artinian $k\dash$algebra $A \in \Art_{/k}$, a *thickening* is an $A' \in \Art_{/k}$ such that $0 \to J \to A' \to A \to 0$, so $\spec A \injects \spec A'$.
:::


:::{.definition title="Small Thickening"}
A **small thickening** is a thickening such that $0 = \mfm_{A'} J$, so $J$ becomes a module for the residue field, and $\dim_k J = 1$.
:::



:::{.lemma title="?"}
Any thickening of $A$, say $B\to A$, fits into a diagram:
\begin{tikzcd}
&  &                                      &  & 0                        &  &                                     &  &   \\
&  &                                      &  &                          &  &                                     &  &   \\
&  & J \arrow[rr]                         &  & A' \arrow[uu] \arrow[rr] &  & A \arrow[dd, Rightarrow] \arrow[rr] &  & 0 \\
&  &                                      &  &                          &  &                                     &  &   \\
0 \arrow[rr] &  & I \arrow[rr] \arrow[uu]              &  & B \arrow[uu] \arrow[rr]  &  & A \arrow[rr]                        &  & 0 \\
&  &                                      &  &                          &  &                                     &  &   \\
&  & I' \arrow[rr, Rightarrow] \arrow[uu] &  & I' \arrow[uu]            &  &                                     &  &   \\
&  &                                      &  &                          &  &                                     &  &   \\
&  & 0 \arrow[uu]                         &  & 0 \arrow[uu]             &  &                                     &  &
\end{tikzcd}
:::


:::{.proof title="of lemma"}
We just need $I' \subset I$ with $\mfm_S I \subset J' \subset I \iff J \mfm_B = 0$.
Choose $J'$ to be a preimage of a codimension 1 vector space in $I/\mfm_B I$.
Thus $J = I/I'$ is 1-dimensional.
:::


Thus any thickening $A$ can be obtained by a sequence of small thickenings.
By the lemma, in principle $F$ and thus $\hat{F}$ are determined by their behavior under small extensions.


### Example

Consider $\pic$, fix $X_{_{/k}}$, start with a line bundle $L_0 \in \pic(x) /\pic(k) = \pic(x)$ and the deformation functor $F(A)$ being the set of line bundles $L$ on $X_A$with $\restrictionof{L}{x} \cong L_0$, modulo isomorphism.
Note that this yields a diagram

\begin{tikzcd}
x \arrow[rr] \arrow[dd, hook] &  & k \arrow[dd, "\text{unique closed point}"] \\
                              &  &                                            \\
X_A \arrow[rr]                &  & \spec A
\end{tikzcd}


This is equal to $(I_x)\inv (L_0)$, where $\pic(X_a) \mapsvia{I_x} \pic(x)$.
If
\[
0 \to J \to A' \to A \to 0
.\]
is a small thickening, we can identify

\begin{tikzcd}
0 \arrow[rr] &  & J \tensor_x \OO_{x} \cong \OO_x \arrow[rr] &  & \OO_{X_{A'}} \arrow[rr]                    &  & \OO_{X_{A}} \arrow[rr]   &  & 0 &  & \\
          &  &                                            &  &                                            &  &                          &  &   &  &\in\text{AbSheaves}                      \\
0 \arrow[rr] &  & \OO_x \arrow[rr, "f\mapsto 1+f"]                           &  & \OO_{X_{A'}}^* \arrow[rr] \arrow[uu, hook] &  & \OO_{X_{A}}^* \arrow[rr] &  & 0 &  &
\end{tikzcd}

This yields a LES
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=tiny]
0 \arrow[rr]            &  & {H^0(X, \OO_x) = k} \arrow[rr] &  & {H^0(X_{A'}, \OO_{x_{A'}}^*) = {A'}^*} \arrow[rr]                                     &  & {H^0(X_{A'}, \OO_{x_{A}}^*) = A^*} \arrow[lllldd] \arrow[rr]         &  & \therefore 0 \\
                        &  &                                &  &                                                                                       &  &                                                                      &  &              \\
\therefore 0 \arrow[rr] &  & {H^1(X, \OO_{x})} \arrow[rr]   &  & {H^1(X_{A'}, \OO_{x_{A'}}^*) = \pic(X_{A'})} \arrow[rr, "\scriptsize\text{restriction to } X_A", outer sep=1em] &  & {H^1(X_{A}, \OO_{x_{A}}^*) = \pic(X_A)} \arrow[lllldd, "\text{obs}"] &  &              \\
                        &  &                                &  &                                                                                       &  &                                                                      &  &              \\
&  & {H^2(X, \OO_x)} \ar[rr]                & &\cdots                                                                                        &  &                                                                      &  &
\end{tikzcd}


:::{.remark}
To understand $F$ on small extensions, we're interested in

1. Given $L \in F_{\text{loc}}(A)$, i.e. $L$ on $X_A$ restricting to $L_0$, when does it extend to $L' \in F_{\text{loc}}(A')$?
  I.e., does there exist an $L'$ on $X_{A'}$ restricting to $L$?

2. Provided such an extension $L'$ exists, how many are there, and what is the structure of the space of extensions?
:::


:::{.question}
We have an $L\in \pic(X_A)$, when does it extend?
:::


By exactness, $L'$ exists iff $\text{obs}(L) = 0\in H^2(X, \OO_x)$, which answers 1.
To answer 2, $(I_x)\inv(L)$ is the set of extensions of $L$, which is a torsor under $H^1(x, \OO_x)$.
Note that these are fixed $k\dash$vector spaces.


:::{.remark}
$H^1(X, \OO_x)$ is interpreted as the **tangent space** of the functor $F$, i.e. $F_{\text{loc}}(K[\eps])$.
Note that if $X$ is projective, line bundles can be unobstructed without the group itself being zero.
:::

For (3), just play with $A = k[\eps]$, which yields $0 \to k \mapsvia{\eps} k[\eps] \to k \to 0$, then

\begin{tikzcd}
0 \arrow[rr] &  & {H^1(X, \OO_x)} \arrow[rr] &  & {H^1(X_{k[\eps]}, \OO_{k[\eps]}^*)} \arrow[rr, "I_x"] &  & {H^1(X, \OO_x^*)} \arrow[ll, bend right=49] \\
             &  &                            &  & {(I_x)\inv(L_0) \in \pic(X_{k[\eps]})}                &  & L_0 \in \pic(x)
\end{tikzcd}


i.e., there is a canonical trivial extension $L_0[\eps]$.

:::{.example title="?"}
Let $X \supset Z_0 \in \hilb_{X_{_{/k}}}(k)$, we computed
\[
T_{Z_0} \hilb_{X_{_{/k}}} =  \hom_{\OO_x}(I_{Z_0}, \OO_z)
.\]
We took $Z_0 \subset X$ and extended to $Z' \subset X_{k[\eps]}$ by base change.
In this case, $F_{\text{loc}}(A)$ was the set of $Z'\subset X_A$ which are flat over $A$, such that base-changing $Z' \cross_{\spec A} \spec k \cong Z$.
This was the same as looking at the preimage restricted to the closed point,
\[
\hilb_{X_{_{/k}}}(A) \mapsvia{i^*} \hilb_{X_{_{/k}}}(k) \\
(i^*)\inv(z_0) \mapsfrom z_0
.\]
Recall how we did the thickening: we had
$0 \to J \to A' \to A \to 0$ with $J^2 = 0$, along with $F$ on $X_A$ which is flat over $A$ with $X_{_{/k}}$ projective, and finally an $F'$ on $X_{A'}$ restricting to $F$.
The criterion we had was $F'$ was flat over $A'$ iff $0 \to J\tensor_{A'} F' \to F'$, i.e. this is injective.
Suppose $z\in F_{\text{loc}}(A)$ and an extension $z' \in F_{\text{loc}}(A')$.
By tensoring the two exact sequences here, we get an exact grid:

\begin{tikzcd}
0 \arrow[rr] \arrow[dd] &             & I_{Z'} \arrow[rr]             &  & \OO_{X_{A'}} \arrow[rr]            &  & \OO_{Z'} \arrow[rr]            &   & 0 \\
                      &             & 0 \arrow[d]                   &  & 0 \arrow[d]                        &  & 0 \arrow[d]                    &   &   \\
J \arrow[dd]            & 0 \arrow[r] & I_{Z_0} \arrow[dd] \arrow[rr] &  & \OO_X \arrow[dd] \arrow[rr]        &  & \OO_{Z_0} \arrow[dd] \arrow[r] & 0 &   \\
                      &             &                               &  &                                    &  &                                &   &   \\
A' \arrow[dd]           & 0 \arrow[r] & I_{Z'} \arrow[rr] \arrow[dd]  &  & \OO_{X_{A'}} \arrow[rr] \arrow[dd] &  & \OO_{Z'} \arrow[dd] \arrow[r]  & 0 &   \\
                      &             &                               &  &                                    &  &                                &   &   \\
A \arrow[dd]            & 0 \arrow[r] & I_Z \arrow[d] \arrow[rr]      &  & \OO_{X_A} \arrow[rr] \arrow[d]     &  & \OO_Z \arrow[d] \arrow[r]      & 0 &   \\
                      &             & 0                             &  & 0                                  &  & 0                              &   &   \\
0                       &             &                               &  &                                    &  &                                &   &
\end{tikzcd}

The space of extension should be a torsor under $\hom_{\OO_X}(I_{Z_0}, \OO_{Z_0})$, which we want to think of as $\hom_{\OO_X}(I_{Z_0}, \OO_{Z_0})$.
Picking a $\phi$ in this hom space, we want to take an extension $I_{Z'} \mapsvia{\phi} I_{Z''}$.

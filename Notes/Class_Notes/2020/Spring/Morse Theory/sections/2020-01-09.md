**Recall:**
For $M^n$ a closed smooth manifold, consider a smooth map $f: M^n \to \RR$.

Definition (Non-degenerate Critical Points)
: A critical point $p$ of $f$ is *non-degenerate* iff $\det( H\definedas \frac{\del^i f}{\del x_i \del x_j}(p)) \neq 0$ in some coordinate system $U$.


Proposition (The Morse Lemma)
:   For any non-degenerate critical point $p$ there exists a coordinate system around $p$ such that

    \begin{align*}
    f(x_1, \cdots, x_n) = f(p) - x_1^2 - x_2^2 - \cdots - x_\lambda^2 + x_{\lambda+1}^2 + \cdots + x_n^2
    .\end{align*}

    $\lambda$ is called the *index of $f$ at $p$*.

Lemma (Relating Index to Eigenvalues)
: $\lambda$ is equal to the number of *negative* eigenvalues of $H(p)$.

Proof
:   A change of coordinates sends $H(p) \to A^t H(p) A$, which (exercise) has the same number of positive and negative values.

    > Exercise: show this assuming that $A$ is invertible and not necessarily orthogonal.
    > Use the fact that $A^t H A$ is diagonalizable.

    This means that $f$ can be written as the quadratic form

    \begin{align*}
    \left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
    -2  & 0  & 0       & 0    & 0 \\
    0   & -2 & 0       & 0    & 0 \\
    0   & 0  & \ddots  &  0   & 0 \\
    0   & 0  & 0       &  2   & 0 \\
    0   & 0  & 0       &  0   & 2
    \end{array}\right]
    .\end{align*}

## Proof of Morse Lemma
Suppose that we have a coordinate chart $U$ around $p$ such that $p\mapsto 0\in U$ and $f(p) = 0$.


### Step 1
Claim
:   There exists a coordinate system around $p$ such that

    \begin{align*}
    f(x) = \sum_{i,j=1}^n x_i x_j h_{ij}(x)
    ,\end{align*}

    where $h_{ij}(x) = h_{ji}(x)$.

Proof
:   Pick a convex neighborhood $V$ of $0\in \RR^n$.

    ![Image](figures/2020-01-09-11:38.png)\

    Restrict $f$ to a path between $x$ and $0$, and by the FTC compute

    \begin{align*}
    I = \int_0^1 \frac{df(tx_1, tx_2, \cdots, tx_n) }{dt}  ~dt = f(x_1, \cdots, x_n) - f(0) = f(x_1, \cdots, x_n)
    .\end{align*}

    since $f(0) = 0$.

    We can compute this in a second way,
    \begin{align*}
    I = \int_0^1 \dd{f}{x_1} x_1 + \dd{f}{x_2} x_2 + \cdots \dd{f}{x_n} x_n ~dt
    \implies \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \int_0^1  \dd{f}{x_i} ~dt = f(x)
    .\end{align*}

    We thus have $f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i g_i(x)$ where $\dd{f}{x_i}(0) = 0$,
    and $\dd{f}{x_i} = x_1 \dd{g_1}{x_i} + \cdots + g_i + x_i \dd{g_i}{x_i} + \cdots + x_n \dd{g_n}{x_i}$.

    When we plug $x = 0$ into this expression, the only term that doesn't vanish is $g_i$, and thus $\dd{f}{x_i}(0) = g_i(0)$ and $g_i(0) = 0$.

    Applying the same result to $g_i$, we obtain $g_i(x) = \sum_{j=1}^n x_j h_{ij}(x)$, and thus $f(x)  = \sum_{i, j =1}^n x_i x_j h_{ij}(x)$.

    We still need to show $h$ is symmetric.
    For every pair $i, j$, there is a term of the form $x_i x_j h_{ij} + x_j x_i h_{ji}$.
    So let $H_{ij}(x) = \frac{h_{ij}(x) + h_{ji}(x)}{2}$ (i.e. symmetrize/average $h$), then $f(x) = \sum_{i, j = 1}^n x_i x_j H_{ij}(x)$ and this shows claim 1.


### Step 2: Induction

Assume that in some coordinate system $U_0$,

\begin{align*}
f(y_1, \cdots, y_n) = \pm y_1^2 \pm y_2^2 \pm \cdots \pm y_{r-1}^2 + \sum_{i, j \geq r} y_i y_j H_{ij}(y_1, \cdots, y_n)
.\end{align*}


Note that $H_{rr}(0)$ is given by the top-left block of $H_{ij}(0)$, which is thus looks like

![Image](figures/2020-01-09-11:41.png)\

Note that this block is symmetric.

Claim (1)
: There exists a linear change of coordinates such that $H_{rr}(0) \neq 0$.

We can use the fact that $\frac{\del^2 f}{\del x_i \del x_j} (0) = H_{ij}(0) + H_{ji}(0) = 2 H_{ij}(0)$, and thus $H_{ij}(0) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\del f}{\del x_i \del x_j} \right)$.

Since $H(0)$ is non-singular, we can find $A$ such that $A^t H(0) A$ has nonzero $rr$ entry, namely by letting the first column of $A$ be an eigenvector of $H(0)$, then $A = [\vector v, \cdots]$ and thus $H(0)A = [\lambda \vector v, \cdots]$ and $A^t[\lambda \vector v] = [\lambda \norm{\vector v}^2, \cdots ]$.

So

\begin{align*}
\sum_{i,j\geq r} y_i y_j H_{ij}(y_1, \cdots, y_n)
&= y_r^2 H_{rr}(y_1, \cdots, y_n) + \sum_{i > r} 2y_i y_r H_{ir}(y_1, \cdots, y_n) \\
&= H_{rr}(y_1, \cdots, y_n) \left(
y_r^2 + \sum_{i > r} 2y_i y_r H_{ir}(y_1, \cdots, y_n)/H_{rr}(y_1, \cdots, y_n)
\right) \\
&= H_{rr}(y_1, \cdots, y_n) (
\left( y_r + \sum_{i > r}^n y_i H_{ir}(y_1, \cdots, y_n) / H_{rr}(y_1, \cdots, y_n) \right)^2 \\
&\cdot \sum_{i > r}^n y_i^2 \left( H_{ir}Y/H_{rr}(Y) \right)^2 \\
&\cdot \sum_{i, j > r}^n H_{ir}(Y)H_{jr}(Y)/H_{rr}(Y))^2 \\
&\quad\text{by completing the square}
.\end{align*}

> Note that $H_{rr}(0) \neq 0$ implies that $H_{rr} \neq 0$ in a neighborhood of zero as well.

Now define a change of coordinates $\phi: U \to \RR^n$ by
\begin{align*}
z_i = \begin{cases}
y_i & i\neq r \\
\sqrt{ H_{rr}(y_1, \cdots, y_n) } \left( y_r + \sum_{i> r} y_i H_{ir}(Y)/H_{rr}(Y) \right) & i=r
\end{cases}
.\end{align*}

This means that
$$
f(z) = \pm z_1^2 \pm \cdots \pm z_{r-1}^2 \pm z_r^2 + \sum_{i, j \geq r+1}^n z_i z_j \tilde{H}(z_1, \cdots, z_n)
.$$

> Exercise: show that $d_0\phi$ is invertible, and by the inverse function theorem, conclude that there is a neighborhood $U_2 \subset U_1$ of 0 on which $\phi$ is still invertible.

$\qed$

Corollary
: The nondegenerate critical points of a Morse function $f$ are isolated.

Proof
:   In some neighborhood around $p$, we have
    $$
    f(x) = f(p) - x_1^2 - \cdots - x_\lambda^2 + x_{\lambda + 1}^2 + \cdots + x_n^2
    ,$$
    Thus $\dd{f}{x_i} = 2x_i$, and so $\dd{f}{x_i} = 0$ iff $x_1 = x_2 = \cdots = x_n = 0$.

Corollary
: On a closed (compact) manifold $M$, a Morse function has only finitely many critical points.

We will need these facts to discuss the $h\dash$cobordism theorem.
For a closed smooth manifold, $\del M = \emptyset$, so $M$ will define a cobordism $\emptyset \to \emptyset$.

Definition (Morse Function)
:   Let $W$ be a cobordism from $M_0 \to M_1$.
    A *Morse function* is a smooth map $f: W\to [a, b]$ such that

    1. $f\inv(a) = M_0$ and $f\inv(b) = M_1$,
    2. All critical points of $f$ are non-degenerate and contained in $\mathrm{int}(W) \definedas W\setminus \del W$.

> So $f$ is equal to the endpoints only on the boundary.

> Next time: existence of Morse functions. This is a fairly restrictive notion, but they are dense in the $C^2$ topology on (?).

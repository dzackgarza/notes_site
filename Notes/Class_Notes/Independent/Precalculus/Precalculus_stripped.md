# Unit 1: Functions

::: {.theorem title="The Pythagorean Theorem"}
If \( a,b \) are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse \( c \), there is a relation
\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
.\]
:::

::: {.theorem title="The Distance Formula"}
If \( p = (x_1, y_1) \) and \( q = (x_2, y_2) \) are points in the Cartesian plane, then there is a **distance function**
\[
d: \left\{{ \text{Pairs of points } (p, q) }\right\} \to {\mathbb{R}}\\
(p, q) &\mapsto d(p, q) \coloneqq\sqrt{ (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_q)^2}
.\]

::: {.definition title="Linear Functions"}
A function \( f:{\mathbb{R}}\to {\mathbb{R}} \) is **linear** if and only if \( f \) has a formula of the following form:
\[
f(x) = \alpha x + \beta && \alpha, \beta \in {\mathbb{R}}
.\]
:::

::: {.definition title="Intercepts"}
Given a function \( f: {\mathbb{R}}\to {\mathbb{R}} \), an **\( x{\hbox{-}} \)intercept** of \( f \) is a point \( (x_0, 0) \) on the graph of \( f \), so \( f(x_0) = 0 \). Equivalently, it is a point on the intersection of the graph and the \( x{\hbox{-}} \)axis.

\

A **\( y{\hbox{-}} \)intercept** of \( f \) is a point \( (0, y_0) \) on the graph of \( f \), so \( f(0) = y_0 \). Equivalently, it is a point on the intersection of the graph and the \( y{\hbox{-}} \)axis.
:::

::: {.definition title="Relation"}
A **relation** on two sets \( X \) and \( Y \) is a set of ordered pairs \( (x, y) \in X \times Y \), so \( R \) can be described as a set:
\[
R = \left\{{ (x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_2), \cdots }\right\} 
.\]

The **domain** of the relation is the set of all \( x\in X \) that occur in the first slot of these pairs, and the **range** is the set of all \( y\in Y \) that occur in the second slot.
:::

::: {.definition title="Function"}
A relation \( R \) is a **function** if it satisfies the following *deterministic property*: for every \( x_0\in \operatorname{dom}(R) \), there is exactly *one* pair of the form \( (x_0, y_0) \in R \).
:::

::: {.remark}
This says we can think of \( X \) as "inputs" and \( Y \) as "output", and a function is a way to unambiguously assign inputs to outputs. It can be useful to think of functions like programs: if I send in an \( x \), what \( y \) should the program return to me? If I run this program today, tomorrow, and 100 years from now, sending in the same \( x \) every time, we might want it to give the same output every time, which is the *deterministic* property: I can *determine* a single unique output if I know what the input is. If my program tells me that \( 2+2=4 \) today but \( 2+2=5 \) tomorrow, who knows what it will return in 100 years! We can't "determine" it.
:::

::: {.slogan}
For domains and ranges:

-   Domains: the set of *meaningful* inputs that the function "knows" how to handle.
-   Ranges: the set of *attainable* outputs that we can expect.
:::

::: {.remark}
To determine a domain:

1.  Naively hope it is *all* of \( {\mathbb{R}} \).
2.  Throw out "problematic" points.
3.  Draw a number line and write out what you are left with in interval notation.
:::

::: {.example title="?"}
Define
\[
f: {\mathbb{R}}&\to {\mathbb{R}}\\
x &\mapsto {1\over x}
.\]

Then \( \operatorname{dom}(f) = {\mathbb{R}}\setminus\left\{{0}\right\}= (-\infty, 0) \cup(0, \infty) \) and \( \mathop{\mathrm{range}}(f) = {\mathbb{R}} \).
:::

::: {.example title="?"}
Define
\[
f: {\mathbb{R}}&\to {\mathbb{R}}\\
x &\mapsto \sqrt{x}
.\]

Then \( \operatorname{dom}(f) = {\mathbb{R}}\setminus(-\infty, 0) = [0, \infty) \) and \( \mathop{\mathrm{range}}(f) = [0, \infty) \).

# Unit 2: Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

# Unit 3: Trigonometric Functions

## General Notes

-   In this section, always draw a picture! Virtually 100% of the time.

    -   In particular, a unit circle should almost always show up.

-   Use exact ratios wherever possible.

-   There are too many details and formulas to just memorize in this unit: focus on the **processes**.

## Common Mistakes

Some facts to remember:

-   \( \sin^{-1}(\theta) \neq 1/\sin(\theta) \). Mnemonic: reciprocals of trigonometric functions already have a better name, here \( \csc(\theta) \).

::: {.remark}
In geometric terms, an angle in radians in the ratio of the arc length \( s(\theta, R) \) to the radius \( R \), so
\[
\theta_R = {s(\theta, R) \over R}
.\]
:::

::: {.definition title="Coterminal Angles"}
If \( \theta \) is an abstract angle, we will say \( \theta + k\,\text{rev} \simeq \theta \) for any integer \( k\in {\mathbb{Z}} \). Any such angle is said to be **coterminal** to \( \theta \).
:::

::: {.remark}
In radians:
\[
\theta_R \simeq \theta_R + k\cdot 2\pi && k\in {\mathbb{Z}}
.\]

In degrees:
\[
\theta_D \simeq \theta_D + k\cdot 360^\circ && k\in {\mathbb{Z}}
.\]
:::

::: {.proposition title="Degrees are related to radians"}
```{=tex}

\[
{\theta \over 1\,\text{rev}}

This implies that
\[
A(R, \theta) &={R^2 \theta \over 2} \\
s(R, \theta) &= R\theta

## Polar Coordinates

::: {.definition title="Unit Circle"}
The **unit circle** is defined as
\[
S^1 \coloneqq\left\{{ \mathbf{p} = (x, y) \in {\mathbb{R}}^2 {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}d(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{0}) = 1 }\right\} = \left\{{ (x, y) \in {\mathbb{R}}^2 {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}x^2 + y^2 = 1 }\right\} 
,\]
the set of all points in the plane that are distance exactly 1 from the origin.
:::

::: {.theorem title="Polar Coordinates"}
If a vector \( \mathbf{v} \) has at an angle of \( \theta \) in radians and has length \( R \), the corresponding point \( \mathbf{p} \) at the end of \( \mathbf{v} \) is given by
\[
\mathbf{p} = {\left[ {x, y} \right]} = {\left[ {R\cos(\theta), R\sin(\theta)} \right]}
.\]

Conversely, if \( (x, y) \) are known, then the corresponding \( R \) and \( \theta \) are given by
\[
[R, \theta] = {\left[ { \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \arctan\qty{y\over x} } \right]}
.\]
:::

::: {.corollary title="Polar Coordinates on $S^1$"}
If \( R=1 \), so \( \mathbf{v} \) is on the unit circle \( S^1 \), then
\[
[x, y] = [\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta)]
.\]
:::

::: {.remark}
This is a very important fact! The \( x, y \) coordinates on the unit circle *literally* corresponding to cosines and sines of subtended angles will be used frequently.
:::

::: {.slogan}
Cosines are like \( x \) coordinates, sines are like \( y \) coordinates.
:::

::: {.example title="?"}
Given \( \theta_R = 4\pi/3 \), what is the corresponding point on the unit circle \( S^1 \)?
:::

::: {.warnings}
Note that \( \sin(\theta), \cos(\theta) \) work for any \( \theta \) at all. However, \( \cos(\theta) = 0 \) sometimes, so \( \tan(\theta) \coloneqq\sin(\theta) / \cos(\theta) \) will on occasion be problematic. Similar story for the other functions.
:::

## Special Angles

For reference: the unit circle.

![image_2021-04-18-21-06-45](figures/image_2021-04-18-21-06-45.png)

::: {.remark}
Idea: we want to partition the circle simultaneously

-   Into 8 pieces, so we increment by \( 2\pi/8 = \pi/4 \)
-   Into 12 pieces, so we increment by \( 2\pi/12 = \pi/6 \).

## Reference Angles and the Flipping Method

::: {.definition title="Reference Angle"}
Given a vector at of length \( R \) and angle \( \theta \), the **reference angle** \( { \theta_{\mathrm{Ref} } } \) is the acute angle in the triangle formed by dropping a perpendicular to the nearest horizontal axis.
:::

::: {.proposition title="?"}
Reference angles for each quadrant:
\[
\text{Quadrant II}: && \theta + { \theta_{\mathrm{Ref} } }= \pi \\
\text{Quadrant III}: && \pi + { \theta_{\mathrm{Ref} } }= \theta \\
\text{Quadrant IV}: && \theta + { \theta_{\mathrm{Ref} } }= 2\pi
.\]
:::

::: {.example title="?"}
Given \( \sin(\theta) = 7/25 \), what are the five remaining trigonometric functions of \( \theta \)?

Method:

1.  Draw a picture! Embed \( \theta \) into a right triangle.
2.  Find the missing side using the Pythagorean theorem.
3.  Use definition of trigonometric functions are ratios.
:::

::: {.remark}
Note that you can not necessarily find the angle \( \theta \) here, but we didn't need it. If we *did* want \( \theta \), we would need an inverse function to free the argument:
\[
\sin(\theta) &= 7/25 \\
\implies \arcsin( \sin(\theta) ) = \arcsin(7/25) \\
\implies \theta = \arcsin(7/25) \\
.\]
:::

## Identities Using Pythagoras

::: {.proposition title="?"}
\[
(\sin(\theta))^2 + (\cos(\theta))^2 &= 1 \\
1 + (\cot(\theta))^2 &= (\csc(\theta))^2 \\
(\tan(\theta))^2 + 1 &= (\sec(\theta))^2
.\]
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
Derive first from Pythagorean theorem in \( S^1 \). Obtain the second by dividing through by \( \qty{\sin(\theta)}^2 \). Obtain the third by dividing through by \( \qty{\cos(\theta)}^2 \).
:::

## Even/Odd Properties

::: {.question}
Thinking of \( \cos(\theta) \) as a function of \( \theta \), is it

-   Even?
-   Odd?
-   Neither?

## Wave Function

::: {.remark}
Motivation: let a vector run around the unit circle, where we think of \( \theta \) as a time parameter. What are its \( x \) and \( y \) coordinates? What happens if we plot \( x(t) \) in a new \( \theta \) plane?
:::

::: {.definition title="Standard Form of a Wave Function"}
The **standard form** of a wave function is given by
\[
f(t) \coloneqq A \cos(\omega (t - \varphi)) + \delta
,\]

where

-   \( A \) is the **amplitude**,
-   \( \omega \) is the **frequency**,
-   \( \phi \) is the **phase shift**, and
-   \( \delta \) is the **vertical shift**.
-   \( P \coloneqq 2\pi / \omega \) is the **period**, so \( f(t+kP) = f(t) \) for all \( k\in {\mathbb{Z}} \).

```
:::

::: {.remark}
Note that this is nothing more than a usual cosine wave, just translated/dilated in the \( x \) direction and the \( y \) direction.
:::

::: {.warnings}
Don't memorize equations like \( y=\sin(Bt+C) \) and e.g. the phase shift if \( \phi = -C/B \). Instead, use a process: always put your equation in standard form, then you can just read off the parameters. For example:
\[
f(t) 
&= \cos(Bt+C) \\
&= \cos( B (t + {C\over B}) ) \\
&= \cos(\omega (t - \phi) ) \\ \\
&\implies B = \omega, \phi = -{C\over B}

::: {.proposition title="Determining the equation of a sine wave"}
Given a picture of a graph of a sine wave,

1.  Draw a horizontal line cutting the wave in half. This will be \( \delta \).
2.  Measure the distance from this midline to a peak. This will be \( {\left\lvert {A} \right\rvert} \).
3.  Restrict to one full period, starting either at a peak (if you want to match \( \cos(t) \)) or a zero (if you want to match \( \sin(t) \)). Pick the period starting as close as possible to the \( y{\hbox{-}} \)axis.
4.  Measure the period \( P \) and reverse-engineer it to get \( \omega \): \( P = 2\pi/\omega \implies \omega = 2\pi/P \).
5.  Measure the distance from the starting point to the \( y{\hbox{-}} \)axis: this is \( \phi \).

## Simplifying Identities

::: {.remark}
The goal: reduce a complicated mess of trigonometric functions to something as simple as possible. We'll use a **boxing-up method**.
:::

::: {.remark}
On verifying identities: if you want to show \( f(\theta) = g(\theta) \), start at one and arrive at the other:
\[
f(\theta) &= \text{simplify } f \\
&= \cdots \\
&= \cdots \\
&= \cdots \\
&= g(\theta) \\
.\]
:::

::: {.warnings}
If you end up with something like \( 1=1 \) or \( 0=0 \), this is hinting at a problem with your logic.

:::

::: {.remark}
As an alternative, you can use the **transitivity of equality**: show that \( f(\theta) = h(\theta) \) for some totally different function \( h \), and then show \( g(\theta) = h(\theta) \) as well.

\]
by showing both sides are separately equal to \( h(\theta) \coloneqq\csc(\theta) - \sin(\theta) \).
:::

## Inverse Functions

### Motivation

::: {.remark}
Motivation: we want a way to solve equations where the unknown \( \theta \) is stuck in the argument of a trigonometric function. For example, for \( \sin: {\mathbb{R}}_A \to {\mathbb{R}}_B \), this would be some function \( f: {\mathbb{R}}_B \to {\mathbb{R}}_A \) such that
\[
f(\sin(\theta)) &= \operatorname{id}(\theta) = \theta \\
\sin(f(y)) &= \operatorname{id}(y) = y
.\]

![Input-Output perspective: important!](figures/image_2021-04-18-22-24-55.png)

Note that we only ever have to define \( f \) on \( \mathop{\mathrm{range}}(\sin) \), since we're only ever sending outputs of \( f \) in as the inputs of \( \sin \). So we need \( \mathop{\mathrm{range}}(\sin) \subset \operatorname{dom}(f) \), noting that \( \mathop{\mathrm{range}}(\sin) = [-1, 1] \): ![image_2021-04-18-22-26-56](figures/image_2021-04-18-22-26-56.png)

Similarly, we need \( \mathop{\mathrm{range}}(f) \subset \operatorname{dom}(\sin) \).
:::

### Using Triangles

::: {.remark}
Optimistically imagine that we had some such inverse function. Then we could evaluate some expressions without even knowing anything else about it. The trick:
\[
\theta &= \arccos(p/q) \\
\implies \cos(\theta) &= \cos(\arccos(p/q)) \\
\implies \cos(\theta) &= p/q
.\]
Now embed this in a triangle. We can't solve for \( \theta \), but we can solve for other trigonometric functions.
:::

::: {.exercise title="Using functional inverse property"}
\[
\cos\qty{ \arccos\qty{ \sqrt 5 \over 5 } } &= {\sqrt 5 \over 5} \\
\arccos\qty{ \cos \qty{ \sqrt 5 \over 5 } } &= {\sqrt 5 \over 5}
.\]
:::

::: {.exercise title="Using a triangle"}
\[
\tan\qty{ \arcsin\qty{ p \over q } } = {p \over \sqrt{q^2 - p^2} }
.\]

![image_2021-04-22-22-14-13](figures/image_2021-04-22-22-14-13.png)
:::

::: {.exercise title="Can't extract angles"}
Compute \( \arcsin(3/5) \).

::: {.warnings}
This is equal to \( \sin^{-1}(3/5) \), which is *not* equal to \( {1\over \sin(3/5)} \)! One way to remember this is that we have another name for reciprocals, here \( \csc(3/5) \).
:::
:::

::: {.solution}
\[
\theta &= \arcsin(3/5) \\
\implies \sin(\theta) &= (3/5) && \text{roughly by injectivity} \\
\implies &= \cdots ?
.\]
We are out of luck, since this isn't a special angle. So we can't find a numerical value of \( \theta \). We can find other trig functions of \( \theta \) though:

![image_2021-04-18-22-30-09](figures/image_2021-04-18-22-30-09.png)

So for example, \( \cos(\arcsin(3/5)) = 4/5 \).
:::

::: {.remark}
Most inverse trigonometric functions can *not* be exactly solved! We'll have to approximate by calculator if we want the actual angle. If we just want *other* trigonometric functions though, we can always embed in a triangle.
:::

::: {.example title="Using triangles"}
Show the following:

-   \( \cos(\arcsin(24/26)) = 10/26 \)
    -   Write \( \theta = \arcsin(24/26) \), note \( \theta \) is in \( [-\pi/2, \pi/2] = \mathop{\mathrm{range}}(\arcsin) \).
-   \( \tan(\arccos(-10/26)) = 10/26 \)
    -   Write \( \theta = \arccos(-10/26) \), note \( \theta \) is in \( [0, \pi] = \mathop{\mathrm{range}}(\arccos) \)
:::

### Defining Inverses

::: {.remark}
The setup: try swapping \( y \) and \( \theta \) in the graph of \( y=\sin(\theta) \):

![image_2021-04-18-22-32-36](figures/image_2021-04-18-22-32-36.png)

Note that the latter is a function (vertical line test) iff the former is injective (horizontal line test). So we take the largest branch where the inverse is a function:

![image_2021-04-18-22-33-27](figures/image_2021-04-18-22-33-27.png)

Back on our original graph, this looks like the following:

![image_2021-04-18-20-53-25](figures/image_2021-04-18-20-53-25.png)

Restricting, we get

-   \( \operatorname{dom}(\arccos) \coloneqq\mathop{\mathrm{range}}({ \color{green} \cos} ) = [-1, 1] \).
-   \( \mathop{\mathrm{range}}(\arccos) \coloneqq\operatorname{dom}( {\color{green} \cos} ) = [0, \pi] \).
:::

::: {.remark}
A similar analysis works for \( \sin(\theta) \):

![image_2021-04-18-22-34-21](figures/image_2021-04-18-22-34-21.png)

Restricting, we get

-   \( \operatorname{dom}(\arcsin) \coloneqq\mathop{\mathrm{range}}({ \color{green} \sin} ) = [-1, 1] \).
-   \( \mathop{\mathrm{range}}(\arcsin) \coloneqq\operatorname{dom}( {\color{green} \sin }) = [-\pi/2, \pi/2] \).
:::

::: {.remark}
This gives us a new tool to solve equations:
\[
\vdots &= \vdots \\
\implies \cos(x) &= b \\
\implies \arccos(\cos(x)) &= \arccos(b) \\
\implies x &= \arccos(b)
,\]
but only if we know this makes sense based on domain/range issues.
:::

::: {.proposition title="Domains of inverse trigonometric functions"}
Restrict domains in the following ways:

-   \( \sin \): \( [-\pi/2, \pi/2] \)

There is an easy way to remember this:

-   Cosines are \( x{\hbox{-}} \)values, pick the upper (or lower) half of the circle to make them unique.
-   Sines are \( y{\hbox{-}} \)values, pick the right (or left) half of the circle to make them unique.

We have some exact values.

Sines should be in QI or QIV:

-   \( \arcsin(1/2) = \pi/6 \)
-   \( \arcsin(\sqrt{3}/2) = \pi/3 \)
-   \( \arcsin(-1/2) = -\pi/6 \)

Cosines should be in QI or QII:

-   \( \arccos(\sqrt{3}/2) = \pi/6 \)
-   \( \arccos(-\sqrt{2}/2) = 3\pi/4 \)
-   \( \arccos(1/2) = \pi/3 \)

Tangents should be in QI or QIV:

-   \( \arctan(0) = 0 \)
-   \( \arctan(1) = \pi/4 \)

Note that if \( f, g \) are an inverse pair, we have
\[
f\circ g = \operatorname{id}\quad\iff\quad f(g(x)) = x,\quad g(f(x)) = x
.\]
However, we have to be careful with domains for trigonometric functions:

-   \( \arcsin(\sin(x)) = x \iff x\in [-\pi/2, \pi/2] \) (restricted domain of \( \sin \))
-   \( \sin(\arcsin(x)) = x \iff x\in [-1, 1] \) (domain of \( \arcsin \))
-   \( \arccos(\cos(x)) = x \iff x\in [0, \pi] \) (restricted domain of \( \cos \))
-   \( \cos(\arccos(x)) = x \iff x\in [-1, 1] \) (domain of \( \arccos \))
-   \( \arctan(\tan(x)) = x \iff x\in [0] \) (restricted domain of \( \tan \))
-   \( \tan(\arctan(x)) = x \iff x\in {\mathbb{R}} \)
    -   Domain of \( \arctan \), then range is \( [-\pi/2, \pi/2] \), which is in the domain of \( \tan \).

## Double/Half-Angle Identities

::: {.remark}
Sometimes we are interested in **superposition** of waves, see [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/rhliflgwmv) for an example. Mathematically this is modeled by adding wave functions together. Similarly, we are sometimes interested in **modulating** or **enveloping** waves, which is modeled by multiplying a wave with another function: see [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/wjgcl2xfbb).

![image_2021-04-18-22-06-08](figures/image_2021-04-18-22-06-08.png)

We can sometimes rewrite these as a *single* wave with a phase shift.
:::

::: {.proposition title="Angle Sum Identities"}
Identities:
\[
\sin(\theta + \psi) &= \sin(\theta) \cos(\psi) + \cos(\theta) \sin(\psi) \\
\cos(\theta + \psi) &= \cos(\theta) \cos(\psi) + \sin(\theta) \sin(\psi)
.\]
Note that you can divide these to get
\[
\tan(\theta + \psi) &= {\tan(\theta) + \tan(\psi) \over 1 - \tan(\theta) \tan(\psi) }
,\]
and replace \( \psi \) with \( -\psi \) and use even/odd properties to get formulas for \( \sin(\theta - \psi), \cos(\theta - \psi) \)
:::

Sines are friendly and cosines are clique-y!
:::

::: {.corollary title="Double angle identities"}
Taking \( \theta = \psi \) is the above identities yields
\[
\sin(2\theta ) 
&= \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) + \cos(\theta) \sin(\theta) \\
&= 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta) \\ \\
\cos(2\theta) 
&= \cos(\theta) \cos(\theta) + \sin(\theta) \sin(\theta) \\
&= \cos^2(\theta) - \sin^2(\theta) 
.\]
:::

::: {.warnings}
The latter is not equal to 1! That would be \( \cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) \).
:::

::: {.remark}
Why do we care? We had 16 special angles, this gives a lot more. For example,
\[
\cos(\pi/12)
=
\cos(\pi/3 - \pi/4) = \cdots \text{ plug in}
.\]
By allowing increments of \( \pi/12 \), we have 24 total angles.
:::

::: {.corollary title="?"}
Starting from the following:
\[
\cos(2\theta) 
&= \cos^2(\theta) - \sin^2(\theta) \\
&= \cos^2(\theta) - \qty{1 - \cos^2(\theta) } \\
&= 2\cos^2(\theta) -1 && \text{using } s^2 + c^2 = 1
,\]
one can solve for
\[
\cos^2(\theta) = {1\over 2}\qty{1 + \cos(2\theta) }
.\]

Similarly
\[
\cos(2\theta) 
&= \cos^2(\theta) - \sin^2(\theta) \\
&= \qty{1 - \sin^2(\theta) } - \sin^2(\theta) \\
&= 1-2\sin^2(\theta) && \text{using } s^2 + c^2 = 1
,\]
solving yields
\[
\sin^2(\theta) = {1\over 2} (1 - \cos(2\theta) )
.\]
:::

::: {.remark}
These are very important in Calculus! This gives us a way to reduce the exponents on expressions like \( \sin^n(\theta) \).

## Bonus: Complex Exponentials

::: {.question}
We spent one entire unit studying the function \( f(x) = e^x \), and another studying the functions \( g(x) = \cos(x), h(x) = \sin(x) \). They seem completely unrelated, but miraculously they are both just shadows of of unifying concept.
:::

::: {.remark}
Components of vectors: every \( \mathbf{v}\in {\mathbb{R}}^2 \) breaks up as the sum of two vectors, i.e. \( \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}_x + \mathbf{v}_y \). In coordinates, if \( \mathbf{v} = (a, b) \), we have \( \mathbf{v}_x = (a, 0) \) and \( \mathbf{v}_y = (0, b) \). Alternatively, we can drop the ordered pair notation and write \( \mathbf{v} = a \widehat{\mathbf{x}} + b \widehat{\mathbf{y}} \).
:::

::: {.remark}
We've worked with the *Cartesian plane* all semester. One powerful tool is replacing this with the *complex* plane. We formally define a new symbol \( i \) and replace the \( \widehat{ \mathbf{y} } \) direction with the \( i \) direction -- this amounts to replacing ordered pairs \( (a, b) \coloneqq a \widehat{ \mathbf{x} } + b\widehat{ \mathbf{y} } \) by a single number \( a + ib \).
:::

::: {.example title="How to work with complex numbers"}
Complex numbers can be added:
\[
(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i
.\]
This is perhaps easier to understand in the ordered pair notation: you just add the components in each component:
\[
[a, b] + [c, d] = [a + c, b + d]
.\]

Complex numbers can be multiplied:
\[
(a +bi)(c+di) 
&= a(c+di) + bi(c+di) \\
&= ac + adi + bci + bdi^2 \\
&= (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i
.\]
This is harder to see in the ordered pair notation.

We can compare complex numbers: they are equal iff their components are equal:
\[
a + bi = c+di \iff a=c \text{ and } b = d
,\]
or in ordered pair notation,
\[
[a, b] = [c, d] \iff a = c \text{ and } b = d
.\]
:::

::: {.remark}
The symbol \( i \) happens to have another algebraic property. Consider the family of equations \( f(x, t) = x^2 + t \), and think about finding the roots. Finding a root is solving \( f(x, t) = 0 \), which is the exact same thing as finding the intersection points with the graph of \( g(x) = 0 \). Taking \( t=0 \) yields \( f(x) = x^2 \), which has a root at zero. Taking \( t<0 \) yields two roots. However, taking \( t>0 \) yields no roots -- at least not in \( {\mathbb{R}} \). As it turns out, the function \( f_1(x) = x^2 + 1 \) and \( g(x) = 0 \) *do* intersect in some other, bigger space, and we're only seeing a shadow of this! In other words, \( x^2+1=0 \) didn't have solutions in \( {\mathbb{R}} \), but *will* have a solution in \( {\mathbb{C}} \).
:::

::: {.remark}
The following is the main link between exponentials and waves:
:::

::: {.proposition title="Euler's Formula"}
\[
e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)
.\]
:::

::: {.remark}
Really, this is just polar coordinates on the unit circle: if we go back to ordered pair notation, this is just giving a point \( (\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta)) \in S^1 \). So the *complex number* \( e^{i\theta} \) is also a *vector* pointing at an angle \( \theta \) from the origin and landing on the unit circle.
:::

::: {.proposition title="Euler's Identity"}
\[
e^{i\pi} = -1
.\]
:::

::: {.remark}
This is remarkable! It relates some of the most fundamental constant numbers in mathematics:

-   \( e = 2.718\ldots \)
-   \( \pi = 3.14159\ldots \)
-   \( -1 \)

Proof: just plug \( \pi \) into Euler's equation. Geometric interpretation: \( \pi \) radians is directly to the left.
:::

::: {.example title="?"}
An application: proving the angle sum formulas algebraically. We start by considering the angle \( \alpha + \beta \). On one hand, Euler's formula says
\[
e^{i( \alpha + \beta) } = \cos(\alpha + \beta) + i\sin(\alpha + \beta) 
= [\cos(\alpha + \beta), \sin(\alpha + \beta)]
.\]

On the other hand, we can use properties of exponentials first and expand:
\[
e^{i(\alpha + \beta)} 
&= e^{i\alpha} e^{i\beta} \\
&= \qty{ \cos(\alpha) + i\sin(\alpha)} \cdot \qty{ \cos(\beta) + i\sin(\beta) } \\
&= 
\cos(\alpha) 
\qty{ \cos(\beta) + i\sin(\beta) } 
+
i\sin(\alpha) 
\qty{ \cos(\beta) + i\sin(\beta) } 
\\
&=
\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) + i \cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta)
+
i\sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) + i^2 \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta)
\\
&= \qty{ \cos(\alpha)\cos( \beta) - \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta) }
+
i
\qty{\cos(\alpha) \sin(\beta) + \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) } \\
&=
\left[ \cos(\alpha)\cos( \beta) - \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta),\quad 
\cos(\alpha) \sin(\beta) + \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta)
\right]
.\]

Now we just equate components:

\[
[\cos(\alpha + \beta), \sin(\alpha + \beta)]
&= \left[ \cos(\alpha)\cos( \beta) - \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta),\quad 
\cos(\alpha) \sin(\beta) + \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta)
\right] \\ \\
\implies \cos(\alpha + \beta) &= \cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) - \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta) \\
\implies \sin(\alpha + \beta) &= \cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta) + \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) 
.\]
:::

::: {.remark}
The analogy goes farther: polar coordinates are essentially just a shadow of complex numbers. Since \( e^{i\theta} \in S^1 \), we can scale by a radius \( r \) to write \( z = re^{i\theta} \) and get any point in the plane. If we just draw a vector \( \mathbf{v}[r\cos(\theta), r\sin(\theta)] \), note that Euler's formula gives us a way to get a complex number \( z \) that corresponds to it:
\[
z \coloneqq re^{i\theta} = r(\cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)) = r\cos(\theta) + i\cdot r\sin(\theta) = [r\cos(\theta), r\sin(\theta)] = \mathbf{v}
.\]
:::

::: {.remark}
Results like these are at the heart of mathematics: having a bunch of equations, seeing patterns, and trying to find some common, unifying, and hopefully simpler structure that underlies all of it. An example you'll see in Calculus: all of the graphs we've been looking at in this class are "shadows" of intersecting shapes in some higher dimensional space!

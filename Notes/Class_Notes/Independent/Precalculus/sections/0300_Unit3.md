# Unit 3: Trigonometric Functions

## General Notes

- In this section, always draw a picture! 
  Virtually 100% of the time.

  - In particular, a unit circle should almost always show up.

- Use exact ratios wherever possible.

- There are too many details and formulas to just memorize in this unit: focus on the **processes**.


## Common Mistakes

Some facts to remember:

- $\sin\inv(\theta) \neq 1/\sin(\theta)$.
  Mnemonic: reciprocals of trigonometric functions already have a better name, here $\csc(\theta)$.

:::

:::{.definition title="Coterminal Angles"}
If $\theta$ is an abstract angle, we will say $\theta + k\,\text{rev} \simeq \theta$ for any integer $k\in \ZZ$. 
Any such angle is said to be **coterminal** to $\theta$.
:::

In radians:
\[
\theta_R \simeq \theta_R + k\cdot 2\pi && k\in \ZZ
.\]

In degrees:
\[
\theta_D \simeq \theta_D + k\cdot 360^\circ && k\in \ZZ
.\]

:::

:::{.proposition title="Degrees are related to radians"}

## Polar Coordinates

:::{.definition title="Unit Circle"}
The **unit circle** is defined as 
\[
S^1 \da \ts{ \vector p = (x, y) \in \RR^2 \st d(\vector p, \vector 0) = 1 } = \ts{ (x, y) \in \RR^2 \st x^2 + y^2 = 1 } 
,\]
the set of all points in the plane that are distance exactly 1 from the origin.
:::

:::{.theorem title="Polar Coordinates"}
If a vector $\vector v$ has at an angle of $\theta$ in radians and has length $R$, the corresponding point $\vector p$ at the end of $\vector v$ is given by
\[
\vector p = \tv{x, y} = \tv{R\cos(\theta), R\sin(\theta)}
.\]

Conversely, if $(x, y)$ are known, then the corresponding $R$ and $\theta$ are given by
\[
[R, \theta] = \tv{ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \arctan\qty{y\over x} }
.\]
:::

:::{.corollary title="Polar Coordinates on $S^1$"}
If $R=1$, so $\vector v$ is on the unit circle $S^1$, then
\[
[x, y] = [\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta)]
.\]
:::

:::{.remark}
This is a very important fact!
The $x, y$ coordinates on the unit circle *literally* corresponding to cosines and sines of subtended angles will be used frequently.
:::


:::{.slogan}
Cosines are like $x$ coordinates, sines are like $y$ coordinates.
:::


:::{.example title="?"}
Given $\theta_R = 4\pi/3$, what is the corresponding point on the unit circle $S^1$?
:::


:::{.warnings}
Note that $\sin(\theta), \cos(\theta)$ work for any $\theta$ at all.
However, $\cos(\theta) = 0$ sometimes, so $\tan(\theta) \da \sin(\theta) / \cos(\theta)$ will on occasion be problematic.
Similar story for the other functions.
:::



## Special Angles
For reference: the unit circle.

:::{.remark}
Idea: we want to partition the circle simultaneously

- Into 8 pieces, so we increment by $2\pi/8 = \pi/4$
- Into 12 pieces, so we increment by $2\pi/12 = \pi/6$.

## Reference Angles and the Flipping Method


:::{.definition title="Reference Angle"}
Given a vector at of length $R$ and angle $\theta$, the **reference angle** 
$\thetaref$ is the acute angle in the triangle formed by dropping a perpendicular to the nearest horizontal axis.
:::


:::{.proposition title="?"}
Reference angles for each quadrant:
\[
\text{Quadrant II}: && \theta + \thetaref = \pi \\
\text{Quadrant III}: && \pi + \thetaref = \theta \\
\text{Quadrant IV}: && \theta + \thetaref = 2\pi
.\]

:::

:::{.example title="?"}
Given $\sin(\theta) = 7/25$, what are the five remaining trigonometric functions of $\theta$?

Method:

1. Draw a picture! 
  Embed $\theta$ into a right triangle.
2. Find the missing side using the Pythagorean theorem.
3. Use definition of trigonometric functions are ratios.
:::

:::{.remark}
Note that you can not necessarily find the angle $\theta$ here, but we didn't need it.
If we *did* want $\theta$, we would need an inverse function to free the argument:
\[
\sin(\theta) &= 7/25 \\
\implies \arcsin( \sin(\theta) ) = \arcsin(7/25) \\
\implies \theta = \arcsin(7/25) \\
.\]

:::



## Identities Using Pythagoras

:::{.proposition title="?"}
\[
(\sin(\theta))^2 + (\cos(\theta))^2 &= 1 \\
1 + (\cot(\theta))^2 &= (\csc(\theta))^2 \\
(\tan(\theta))^2 + 1 &= (\sec(\theta))^2
.\]
:::


:::{.proof title="?"}
Derive first from Pythagorean theorem in $S^1$.
Obtain the second by dividing through by $\qty{\sin(\theta)}^2$.
Obtain the third by dividing through by $\qty{\cos(\theta)}^2$.
:::

- Even?

## Wave Function


:::{.remark}
Motivation: let a vector run around the unit circle, where we think of $\theta$ as a time parameter.
What are its $x$ and $y$ coordinates?
What happens if we plot $x(t)$ in a new $\theta$ plane?
:::


:::{.definition title="Standard Form of a Wave Function"}
The **standard form** of a wave function is given by 
\[
f(t) \da A \cos(\omega (t - \varphi)) + \delta
,\]

where 

- $A$ is the **amplitude**,
- $\omega$ is the **frequency**,
- $\phi$ is the **phase shift**, and
- $\delta$ is the **vertical shift**.
- $P \da 2\pi / \omega$ is the **period**, so $f(t+kP) = f(t)$ for all $k\in \ZZ$.

\todo[inline]{Insert plot}
:::


:::{.remark}
Note that this is nothing more than a usual cosine wave, just translated/dilated in the $x$ direction and the $y$ direction.
:::


:::{.warnings}
Don't memorize equations like $y=\sin(Bt+C)$ and e.g. the phase shift if $\phi = -C/B$.
Instead, use a process: always put your equation in standard form, then you can just read off the parameters.
For example:
\[
f(t) 
&= \cos(Bt+C) \\
&= \cos( B (t + {C\over B}) ) \\
&= \cos(\omega (t - \phi) ) \\ \\
&\implies B = \omega, \phi = -{C\over B}
.\]

How to plot the graph of a wave equation:

2. Read off the parameters to build a rectangular box of width $P$ and height $2\abs{A}$ about the line $y=\delta$.
3. Break the box into 4 pieces using the key points $t = \phi + {k\over 4}P$ for $k=0,1,2,3,4$.
:::

\[
f(t) = 2 \cos\qty{5t - {\pi \over 2} } + 7

\[
f(t) = -2\sin(3t-7)

:::


:::{.proposition title="Determining the equation of a sine wave"}
Given a picture of a graph of a sine wave,

1. Draw a horizontal line cutting the wave in half.
  This will be $\delta$.
2. Measure the distance from this midline to a peak.
  This will be $\abs{A}$.
2. Restrict to one full period, starting either at a peak (if you want to match $\cos(t)$) or a zero (if you want to match $\sin(t)$).
  Pick the period starting as close as possible to the $y\dash$axis.
3. Measure the period $P$ and reverse-engineer it to get $\omega$: 
  $P = 2\pi/\omega \implies \omega = 2\pi/P$.
4. Measure the distance from the starting point to the $y\dash$axis: this is $\phi$.

:::

## Simplifying Identities

:::{.remark}
The goal: reduce a complicated mess of trigonometric functions to something as simple as possible.
We'll use a **boxing-up method**.
:::

:::{.remark}
On verifying identities: if you want to show $f(\theta) = g(\theta)$, start at one and arrive at the other:
\[
f(\theta) &= \text{simplify } f \\
&= \cdots \\
&= \cdots \\
&= \cdots \\
&= g(\theta) \\
.\]

:::

:::{.warnings}
If you end up with something like $1=1$ or $0=0$, this is hinting at a problem with your logic.
:::

:::{.exercise title="?"}
Simplify the following:
\[
F(\theta) \da \qty{ \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) \over \cot(\theta)} \cos(\theta)\csc(\theta)
.\]
:::

:::{.solution}
\[
F = s \qty{s \over c}
.\]

:::

:::{.remark}
As an alternative, you can use the **transitivity of equality**: show that $f(\theta) = h(\theta)$ for some totally different function $h$, and then show $g(\theta) = h(\theta)$ as well.

![image_2021-04-18-21-58-52](figures/image_2021-04-18-21-58-52.png)

:::

:::{.exercise title="Reducing both sides to a common expression"}
Show the following identity:
\[
{\sin(-\theta) + \csc(\theta)} = \cot(\theta) \cos(\theta)
\]
by showing both sides are separately equal to $h(\theta) \da \csc(\theta) - \sin(\theta)$.

:::

## Inverse Functions

### Motivation

:::{.remark}
Motivation: we want a way to solve equations where the unknown $\theta$ is stuck in the argument of a trigonometric function.
For example, for $\sin: \RR_A \to \RR_B$, this would be some function $f: \RR_B \to \RR_A$ such that
\[
f(\sin(\theta)) &= \id(\theta) = \theta \\
\sin(f(y)) &= \id(y) = y
.\]

![Input-Output perspective: important!](figures/image_2021-04-18-22-24-55.png)

Note that we only ever have to define $f$ on $\range(\sin)$, since we're only ever sending outputs of $f$ in as the inputs of $\sin$.
So we need $\range(\sin) \subset \dom(f)$, noting that $\range(\sin) = [-1, 1]$:
![image_2021-04-18-22-26-56](figures/image_2021-04-18-22-26-56.png)

Similarly, we need $\range(f) \subset \dom(\sin)$.
:::

### Using Triangles


:::{.remark}
Optimistically imagine that we had some such inverse function.
Then we could evaluate some expressions without even knowing anything else about it.
The trick: 
\[
\theta &= \arccos(p/q) \\
\implies \cos(\theta) &= \cos(\arccos(p/q)) \\
\implies \cos(\theta) &= p/q
.\]
Now embed this in a triangle.
We can't solve for $\theta$, but we can solve for other trigonometric functions.
:::


:::{.exercise title="Using functional inverse property"}
\[
\cos\qty{ \arccos\qty{ \sqrt 5 \over 5 } } &= {\sqrt 5 \over 5} \\
\arccos\qty{ \cos \qty{ \sqrt 5 \over 5 } } &= {\sqrt 5 \over 5}
.\]

:::

:::{.exercise title="Using a triangle"}
\[
\tan\qty{ \arcsin\qty{ p \over q } } = {p \over \sqrt{q^2 - p^2} }
.\]

![image_2021-04-22-22-14-13](figures/image_2021-04-22-22-14-13.png)

:::

:::{.exercise title="Can't extract angles"}
Compute $\arcsin(3/5)$.

:::{.warnings}
This is equal to $\sin\inv(3/5)$, which is *not* equal to ${1\over \sin(3/5)}$!
One way to remember this is that we have another name for reciprocals, here $\csc(3/5)$.
:::
:::

:::{.solution}
\[
\theta &= \arcsin(3/5) \\
\implies \sin(\theta) &= (3/5) && \text{roughly by injectivity} \\
\implies &= \cdots ?
.\]
We are out of luck, since this isn't a special angle.
So we can't find a numerical value of $\theta$.
We can find other trig functions of $\theta$ though:

![image_2021-04-18-22-30-09](figures/image_2021-04-18-22-30-09.png)

So for example, $\cos(\arcsin(3/5)) = 4/5$.
:::

:::{.remark}
Most inverse trigonometric functions can *not* be exactly solved!
We'll have to approximate by calculator if we want the actual angle.
If we just want *other* trigonometric functions though, we can always embed in a triangle.
:::

:::{.example title="Using triangles"}
Show the following:

- $\cos(\arcsin(24/26)) = 10/26$
  - Write $\theta = \arcsin(24/26)$, note $\theta$ is in $[-\pi/2, \pi/2] = \range(\arcsin)$.
- $\tan(\arccos(-10/26)) = 10/26$
  - Write $\theta = \arccos(-10/26)$, note $\theta$ is in $[0, \pi] = \range(\arccos)$
:::

### Defining Inverses

:::{.remark}
The setup: try swapping $y$ and $\theta$ in the graph of $y=\sin(\theta)$:

![image_2021-04-18-22-32-36](figures/image_2021-04-18-22-32-36.png)

Note that the latter is a function (vertical line test) iff the former is injective (horizontal line test).
So we take the largest branch where the inverse is a function:

![image_2021-04-18-22-33-27](figures/image_2021-04-18-22-33-27.png)

Back on our original graph, this looks like the following:

![image_2021-04-18-20-53-25](figures/image_2021-04-18-20-53-25.png)

Restricting, we get

- $\dom(\arccos) \da \range({ \color{green} \cos} ) = [-1, 1]$.
- $\range(\arccos) \da \dom( {\color{green} \cos} ) = [0, \pi]$.

:::

:::{.remark}
A similar analysis works for $\sin(\theta)$:

![image_2021-04-18-22-34-21](figures/image_2021-04-18-22-34-21.png)

Restricting, we get

- $\dom(\arcsin) \da \range({ \color{green} \sin} ) = [-1, 1]$.
- $\range(\arcsin) \da \dom( {\color{green} \sin }) = [-\pi/2, \pi/2]$.
:::


:::{.remark}
This gives us a new tool to solve equations:
\[
\vdots &= \vdots \\
\implies \cos(x) &= b \\
\implies \arccos(\cos(x)) &= \arccos(b) \\
\implies x &= \arccos(b)
,\]
but only if we know this makes sense based on domain/range issues.

:::


:::{.proposition title="Domains of inverse trigonometric functions"}

Restrict domains in the following ways:

- $\sin$: $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$
- $\cos: [0, \pi]$
- $\tan: [-\pi/2, \pi/2]$

| Function | Domain | Range |
|----------|--------|-------|
|$\arcsin$    | $[-1, 1]$   | $[-\pi/2, \pi /2]$  |
|$\arccos$    | $[-1, 1]$   | $[0, \pi]$     |
|$\arctan$    | $\RR$       | $(-\pi/2, \pi/2)$     |
|$\arccsc$    | $\RR \smts{0, \pm {\pi}, \pm{2\pi}, \cdots}$  | $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]\smts{0}$     |
|$\arcsec$    | $\RR \smts{\pm {\pi \over 2}, \pm{3\pi \over 2}, \cdots}$  | $[0, \pi]\smts{\pi/2}$     |
|$\arccot$    | $\RR$  | $(0, \pi)$     |

:::{.slogan}
There is an easy way to remember this:

- Cosines are $x\dash$values, pick the upper (or lower) half of the circle to make them unique.
- Sines are $y\dash$values, pick the right (or left) half of the circle to make them unique.

![image_2021-04-22-22-00-04](figures/image_2021-04-22-22-00-04.png)

:::{.example title="Using special angles"}

![Unit Circle](figures/image_2021-04-18-21-06-45.png)

We have some exact values.

Sines should be in QI or QIV:

- $\arcsin(1/2) = \pi/6$
- $\arcsin(\sqrt{3}/2) = \pi/3$
- $\arcsin(-1/2) = -\pi/6$


Cosines should be in QI or QII:

- $\arccos(\sqrt{3}/2) = \pi/6$
- $\arccos(-\sqrt{2}/2) = 3\pi/4$
- $\arccos(1/2) = \pi/3$

Tangents should be in QI or QIV:

- $\arctan(\sqrt{3}/3) = \pi/6$
- $\arctan(0) = 0$
- $\arctan(1) = \pi/4$



:::



:::{.warnings}
Note that if $f, g$ are an inverse pair, we have
\[
f\circ g = \id \quad\iff\quad f(g(x)) = x,\quad g(f(x)) = x
.\]
However, we have to be careful with domains for trigonometric functions:

- $\arcsin(\sin(x)) = x \iff x\in [-\pi/2, \pi/2]$ (restricted domain of $\sin$)
- $\sin(\arcsin(x)) = x \iff x\in [-1, 1]$ (domain of $\arcsin$)
- $\arccos(\cos(x)) = x \iff x\in [0, \pi]$ (restricted domain of $\cos$)
- $\cos(\arccos(x)) = x \iff x\in [-1, 1]$ (domain of $\arccos$)
- $\arctan(\tan(x)) = x \iff x\in [0]$ (restricted domain of $\tan$)
- $\tan(\arctan(x)) = x \iff x\in \RR$
  - Domain of $\arctan$, then range is $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$, which is in the domain of $\tan$.

## Double/Half-Angle Identities



:::{.remark}
Sometimes we are interested in **superposition** of waves, see [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/rhliflgwmv) for an example.
Mathematically this is modeled by adding wave functions together.
Similarly, we are sometimes interested in **modulating** or **enveloping** waves, which is modeled by multiplying a wave with another function: see [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/wjgcl2xfbb).

![image_2021-04-18-22-06-08](figures/image_2021-04-18-22-06-08.png)

We can sometimes rewrite these as a *single* wave with a phase shift.

\cos(\theta + \psi) &= \cos(\theta) \cos(\psi) + \sin(\theta) \sin(\psi)
.\]
Note that you can divide these to get
\[
\tan(\theta + \psi) &= {\tan(\theta) + \tan(\psi) \over 1 - \tan(\theta) \tan(\psi) }
,\]
and replace $\psi$ with $-\psi$ and use even/odd properties to get formulas for $\sin(\theta - \psi), \cos(\theta - \psi)$

\cos(2\theta)

The latter is not equal to 1!
That would be $\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta)$.
:::

:::{.remark}
Why do we care? 
We had 16 special angles, this gives a lot more.
For example, 
\[
\cos(\pi/12)
=
\cos(\pi/3 - \pi/4) = \cdots \text{ plug in}
.\]
By allowing increments of $\pi/12$, we have 24 total angles.
:::

:::{.corollary title="?"}
Starting from the following:
\[
\cos(2\theta) 
&= \cos^2(\theta) - \sin^2(\theta) \\
&= \cos^2(\theta) - \qty{1 - \cos^2(\theta) } \\
&= 2\cos^2(\theta) -1 && \text{using } s^2 + c^2 = 1
,\]
one can solve for
\[
\cos^2(\theta) = {1\over 2}\qty{1 + \cos(2\theta) }
.\]

Similarly
\[
\cos(2\theta) 
&= \cos^2(\theta) - \sin^2(\theta) \\
&= \qty{1 - \sin^2(\theta) } - \sin^2(\theta) \\
&= 1-2\sin^2(\theta) && \text{using } s^2 + c^2 = 1
,\]
solving yields
\[
\sin^2(\theta) = {1\over 2} (1 - \cos(2\theta) )
.\]

These are very important in Calculus! 
This gives us a way to reduce the exponents on expressions like $\sin^n(\theta)$.

## Bonus: Complex Exponentials


:::{.question}
We spent one entire unit studying the function $f(x) = e^x$, and another studying the functions $g(x) = \cos(x), h(x) = \sin(x)$.

Components of vectors: every $\vector v\in \RR^2$ breaks up as the sum of two vectors, i.e. $\vector v = \vector v_x + \vector v_y$.
In coordinates, if $\vector v = (a, b)$, we have $\vector v_x = (a, 0)$ and $\vector v_y = (0, b)$.
Alternatively, we can drop the ordered pair notation and write $\vector v = a \hat{\vector x}  + b \hat{\vector y}$.

We formally define a new symbol $i$ and replace the $\vhat{y}$ direction with the $i$ direction -- this amounts to replacing ordered pairs $(a, b) \da a \vhat{x} + b\vhat{y}$ by a single number $a + ib$.

:::{.example title="How to work with complex numbers"}
Complex numbers can be added:
\[
(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i
.\]
This is perhaps easier to understand in the ordered pair notation: you just add the components in each component:
\[
[a, b] + [c, d] = [a + c, b + d]
.\]


Complex numbers can be multiplied:
\[
(a +bi)(c+di) 
&= a(c+di) + bi(c+di) \\
&= ac + adi + bci + bdi^2 \\
&= (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i
.\]
This is harder to see in the ordered pair notation.

We can compare complex numbers: they are equal iff their components are equal:
\[
a + bi = c+di \iff a=c \text{ and } b = d
,\]
or in ordered pair notation,
\[
[a, b] = [c, d] \iff a = c \text{ and } b = d
.\]

:::{.remark}
The symbol $i$ happens to have another algebraic property.
Consider the family of equations $f(x, t) = x^2 + t$, and think about finding the roots.
Finding a root is solving $f(x, t) = 0$, which is the exact same thing as finding the intersection points with the graph of $g(x) = 0$.
Taking $t=0$ yields $f(x) = x^2$, which has a root at zero.
Taking $t<0$ yields two roots.
However, taking $t>0$ yields no roots -- at least not in $\RR$.
As it turns out, the function $f_1(x) = x^2 + 1$ and $g(x) = 0$ *do* intersect in some other, bigger space, and we're only seeing a shadow of this!
In other words, $x^2+1=0$ didn't have solutions in $\RR$, but *will* have a solution in $\CC$.

The following is the main link between exponentials and waves:

:::{.proposition title="Euler's Formula"}
\[
e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)
.\]
:::


:::{.remark}
Really, this is just polar coordinates on the unit circle: if we go back to ordered pair notation, this is just giving a point $(\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta)) \in S^1$.
So the *complex number* $e^{i\theta}$ is also a *vector* pointing at an angle $\theta$ from the origin and landing on the unit circle.

:::{.proposition title="Euler's Identity"}
\[
e^{i\pi} = -1
.\]

:::


:::{.remark}
This is remarkable!
It relates some of the most fundamental constant numbers in mathematics:

- $e = 2.718\ldots$
- $\pi = 3.14159\ldots$
- $-1$

Proof: just plug $\pi$ into Euler's equation.
Geometric interpretation: $\pi$ radians is directly to the left.

An application: proving the angle sum formulas algebraically.
We start by considering the angle $\alpha + \beta$.
On one hand, Euler's formula says
\[
e^{i( \alpha + \beta) } = \cos(\alpha + \beta) + i\sin(\alpha + \beta) 
= [\cos(\alpha + \beta), \sin(\alpha + \beta)]
.\]

On the other hand, we can use properties of exponentials first and expand:
\[
e^{i(\alpha + \beta)} 
&= e^{i\alpha} e^{i\beta} \\
&= \qty{ \cos(\alpha) + i\sin(\alpha)} \cdot \qty{ \cos(\beta) + i\sin(\beta) } \\
&= 
\cos(\alpha) 
\qty{ \cos(\beta) + i\sin(\beta) } 
+
i\sin(\alpha) 
\qty{ \cos(\beta) + i\sin(\beta) } 
\\
&=
\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) + i \cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta)
+
i\sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) + i^2 \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta)
\\
&= \qty{ \cos(\alpha)\cos( \beta) - \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta) }
+
i
\qty{\cos(\alpha) \sin(\beta) + \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) } \\
&=
\left[ \cos(\alpha)\cos( \beta) - \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta),\quad 
\cos(\alpha) \sin(\beta) + \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta)
\right]
.\]

Now we just equate components:

\[
[\cos(\alpha + \beta), \sin(\alpha + \beta)]
&= \left[ \cos(\alpha)\cos( \beta) - \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta),\quad 
\cos(\alpha) \sin(\beta) + \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta)
\right] \\ \\
\implies \cos(\alpha + \beta) &= \cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) - \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta) \\
\implies \sin(\alpha + \beta) &= \cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta) + \sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) 
.\]

The analogy goes farther: polar coordinates are essentially just a shadow of complex numbers.
Since $e^{i\theta} \in S^1$, we can scale by a radius $r$ to write $z = re^{i\theta}$ and get any point in the plane.
If we just draw a vector $\vector v[r\cos(\theta), r\sin(\theta)]$, note that Euler's formula gives us a way to get a complex number $z$ that corresponds to it:
\[
z \da re^{i\theta} = r(\cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)) = r\cos(\theta) + i\cdot r\sin(\theta) = [r\cos(\theta), r\sin(\theta)] = \vector v
.\]

Results like these are at the heart of mathematics: having a bunch of equations, seeing patterns, and trying to find some common, unifying, and hopefully simpler structure that underlies all of it.
An example you'll see in Calculus: all of the graphs we've been looking at in this class are "shadows" of intersecting shapes in some higher dimensional space!

# Relative Homology

Continuing discussion of relative homology:
\[
H_*(X,A) = H(C_* X/ C_* A)
\]

When axiomatized, generally relies on property of **excision**, which relates to the following theorem:

:::{.theorem title="?"}
If $U \subseteq A \subseteq X$ and $cl(U) \subseteq int(A)$, then 
\[
H(X, A) \cong H(X-U, A-U)
\]
or equivalently setting $X = A \union B$ where $X = int(A) \union int(B)$, then 
\[
H(X,A) \cong H(B, A\intersect B)
\]
:::

:::{.proof}
Recall from proof of Mayer Vietoris we used 
\[
C_*(A+B) \leq C_* X = \ts{\text{singular simplexes from } A \text{ or } B}
\]
This yields a SES
  \[
    0 \mapsvia{} C_*(A) \mapsvia{} C_*(A+B) \mapsvia{} C_*(B, A\intersect B)\mapsvia{} 0
    \]

Look at inclusion $C_*(A+B) \mapsvia{\iota} C_*(X)$ and its placement in the SES 
\[
0\mapsvia{} C_*(A) \mapsvia{} C_*(X) \mapsvia{} C_*(X,A)\mapsvia{} 0
\]
  These yield commuting long exact sequences:

\[
H_n(A) \mapsvia{} H_n(A+B) \mapsvia{} H_n(A, A\cap B) \mapsvia{} H_{n-1}(A) \mapsvia{} H_{n-1}(A+B) \mapsvia{} \cdots
\]

\[
H_n(A) \mapsvia{} H_n(X) \mapsvia{} H_n(X,A) \mapsvia{} H_{n-1}(A) \mapsvia{} H_{n-1}(X) \mapsvia{} \cdots
\]

Here the 5 lemma applies, since there are two maps that are identifications and $H_*(A+B) \cong H_*(X)$ by Mayer-Vietoris.

:::{.example}
Look at *local homology*, i.e. look at $H_*(X, X-\{*\})$, this is equivalent to $H_*(U, U-\{*\})$ for **any** open neighborhood $U\supseteq \{*\}$. 
Take any open $V \subseteq \RR^n$ as an example, then 
\[
H_*(V,V-\pt) \cong H_*(U, U-\pt)
\]
for $U$ an epsilon ball around the point, but then by homeomorphism this is equal to 
\[
H_*(\RR^n, \RR^n - \pt) = \ZZ\indic{\text{dim} = n}
\]
:::

:::{.remark}
This is a stronger statement than "Brouwer's Invariance of Domain", because this invariant picks up the dimension $n$.

Note that this invariance is given by the following statement: no open set of $\RR^n$ can be homeomorphic to a subset of $\RR^m$ for $m\neq n$.

This can be used to show that e.g. singular points are weird, e.g. if this doesn't yield $\ZZ$ everywhere in a space $X$ then $X$ can not be a manifold.


## Collapsing Theorem

If $X \supseteq A$ and $A$ has an open neighborhood $V\supseteq A$ which deformation retracts onto it then $H_*(X,A) \cong \tilde H_*(X/A)$.

Aside:

:::{.definition title="Deformation"}
A *deformation* is given by 
$A \injects_i V \surjects_p A$ where $p\circ i = \id_A$

:::

:::{.definition title="Deformation Retract"}
A *deformation retract* is given by $V \surjects_p A \injects_i V$ where $i\circ p \homotopic \id_V$
:::

:::{.proof}
Take a homeomorphism 
\[
(X-A, V-A) \cong (X/A - A/A, V/A - A/A)
\]
by homeomorphisms of each component.

By excision, the LHS is isomorphic to $H_*(X, V)$, while the RHS is given by
\[
H_*(X/A - \pt, V/A - \pt) \cong H_*(X/A, V/A)
\]

Yields LES of triple 
\[
0=H_n(V,A) \mapsvia{} H_n(X, A) \mapsvia{} H_n(X,V) \mapsvia{} H_{n-1}(V,A) = 0
\]
so $H_n(X,A) \cong H_n(X,V)$.

So the RHS is equal to 
\[
H_*(X/A, V/A) = H_*(X/A, A/A) = H_*(X/A, \pt) = \tilde H_*(X/A)
\]
:::

Note that the collapsing argument doesn't work for local homology. 

:::{.example}
Consider
\[
H_*(\RR^n, \RR^n - \pt) \not\cong \tilde H_*(\RR^n/\RR^n - \pt)
.\]
The LHS depends on $n$ while the RHS doesn't. 
Note also the weird quotient topology on the RHS.

## Cellular Homology


If $X$ is a CW-complex, then let $X^n$ be the $n$-skeleton. 
We can then define 
\[
C_n^{\text{cell}}(X) \definedas H_n(X^n, X^{n-1}) \cong H_n(X^n/X^{n-1}) \cong \bigvee_{\alpha \in I^n} S_\alpha^n = \bigoplus_\alpha \ZZ
.\]

Can now introduce a boundary map $\del:C_n \into C_{n-1}$ from 
\[
\delta: H_n(X^n, X^{n-1}) \into H_n(X^{n-1}, X^{n-2})
\]
obtained from the LES of the triple $(X^n, X^{n-1}, X^{n-2})$.

Why is this a chain complex? 
Does $\del^2 = 0$?

Look at $[z] \in H_n(X^n, X^{n-1})$. 
Then $z\in C_n(X)$ is a singular $n$ simplex, must be a cycle such that 
\[
\del z \in C_{n-1}X^{n-1} \subseteq C_{n-1}X^n
\]
Then 
\[
\delta([z]) = [\del z] \in C_{n-1}(X^{n-1}) / C_{n-1}(X^{n-2})
\]
Note the distinction between actual cycles and relative cycles. 
But then 
\[
[\del \del z] = [0] \in H_{n-1}(X^{n-2}, X^{n-3})
\]

Makes the problem tractable, yields integer linear algebra for finite CW complexes! This makes things easier to actually compute.

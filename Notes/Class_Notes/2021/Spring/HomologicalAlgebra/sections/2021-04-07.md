## 6.3: Shapiro's Lemma, (co)Induced Modules (cont)

:::{.remark}
Recall that we had two ways of inducing an \(H\dash\)module up to a \(G\dash\)module for $H\leq G$ a subgroup.
In this case, we can take cohomology with coefficients in any $B\in \mods{\ZZ H}$.
Shapiro's lemma (or Frobenius Reciprocity) allowed compute homology and cohomology when the coefficients are in induced or coinduced modules:

\[
H_*(G; \Ind_H^G B) &\cong H_*(H; B) &&(1) \\
H^*(G; \Coind^G B) &\cong H^*(H; B) &&(2)
.\]
:::

:::{.proof title="of Shapiro's lemma"}
Let $P_* \to \ZZ$ be a right $\ZZG\dash$projective resolution of $\ZZ$.
Since $\ZZG$ is a free $\ZZ H$ module, these are still projective over $\ZZ H$.
Then take
\[
P_* \tensor_{\ZZG} (\ZZG \tensor_{\ZZ H} B) \cong P_* \tensor_{\ZZ H} B
.\]
The homology of the left-hand side computes $\Tor_*^{\ZZG }(\ZZ, \Ind_H^G B)$.
On the other hand, we can consider $P_*$ to be a projective resolution in $\ZZ H$ and thus the homology of the right-hand side is $\Tor_*^{\ZZ H}(\ZZ, B)$, which is $H_*(H; B)$.

For (2), use the tensor-hom adjunction.

:::{.theorem title="Adjoints of Restriction are Induction and Coinduction"}
For $H\leq G, A\in \mods{\ZZG}, B\in \mods{\ZZH}$, 
\[
\Ext_G^*(\Ind_h^G B, A) \cong \Ext_H^*(B, \Res_H^G A) && (1) \\
\Ext_G^*(A, \Coind_H^G B) \cong \Ext_H^*(\Res_H^G A, B) && (1) 
.\]
:::

:::{.remark}
Taking $A = \ZZ\in \mods{\ZZG}^\Triv$, one gets result (2) in Shapiro's lemma.
This shows that $\Ind$ is left adjoint to $\Res$ and $\Coind$ is right adjoint to it, so these will have derived functors.
A special case is when $H = \ts{ 1 }$ is the trivial group, in which case any $H\dash$module $B$ is an abelian group such that $B^H = B = B_H$.
So $(\wait)^H, (\wait)_H$ are exact, and thus their higher derived functors are zero, i.e. $H_n(H, B) = 0 = H^n(H; B)$ for $n>0$.
Moreover 
\[
H_n(G; \ZZG \tensor_\ZZ B) \cong H^n( G, \Hom_\ZZ( \ZZ G, B))
\cong
\begin{cases}
B & n = 0 
\\
0 & n > 0.
\end{cases}
\]

:::{.lemma title="?"}
If the index $[G: H]$ (i.e. the number of left or right cosets) is finite, then 
\[
\Ind_H^G B \cong \Coind_H^G B && \in \mods{G} 
.\]
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
Let $X$ be a set of left coset representatives for $G/H$, where we'll take the convention that left cosets are of the form $gH$.
Then $X$ is a free $\modsright{\ZZH}\dash$basis of $\ZZG$, so
\[
\Ind_H^G B \cong \ZZG \tensor_{\ZZH} B \cong \bigoplus_{x\in X} x\tensor B &&\in \mods{\ZZ}
.\]
How does $g\actson x\tensor b$ for $g\in G$?
We have $gx\in yH$ for some $y\in X$, so for some $h\in H$ we have
\[
gx = gh
.\]

We can then compute
\[
g(x\tensor b)
&= 
gx \tensor b\\
&=
yh \tensor b\\
&=
y \tensor hb
.\]
since $h\in \ZZ H$.
Now $X\inv \da \ts{ x\inv \st x\in X }$ is a set of coset representatives for $\quotleft{G}{H}$ and hence a left $\ZZH\dash$basis for $\ZZG$.
We can thus write
\[
\Coind_H^G B 
&\cong \Hom_{\ZZ H}(\ZZG, B) \\
&\cong \Hom_{\ZZH} \qty{ \bigoplus_{x\in X} \ZZH x\inv, B } \\
&= \prod_{x\in X} \Hom_{\ZZH}(\ZZH x\inv, B) && \text{by exc. A.1.4}\\
&= \prod_{x\in X} \pi_x(A)
,\]
where each term is a copy of $A$.
This follows because we can specify such a module hom by specifying the image of a basis.
So here for $b\in B$, $\pi_x(B)$ for a fixed $x$ is the \(H\dash\)module morphism $\ZZG \to B$ where $x\inv \mapsto b$ and $z\inv \mapsto 0$ for $z\neq x$.

How does $G$ act on these homs?
Using equation (??)
\todo[inline]{Sort out which equation this was!}
we have
\[
y\inv g = hx\inv 
,\]
and thus
\[
( g\cdot \pi_x(b))(y\inv) 
&= (\pi_x(b))( y\inv g) \\
&= (\pi_x(b)) (hx\inv ) \\
&= h(\pi_x(b))(x\inv) \\
&= hb
,\]
and $y\inv$ is the only one that lights up for the $G\dash$action, i.e. $(g\cdot \pi_x(b))(z\inv) =0$ for $y\neq z$, and thus
\[
g\cdot \pi_x(b) = \pi_y(hb)
.\]
Thus we have a \(G\dash\)module map
\[
\Ind_H^G B & \mapsvia{\sim}  \Coind_H^G B \\
\bigoplus_{x\in X} x\tensor B & \mapsvia{\sim} \bigoplus_{x\in X} \pi_x B \\
x\tensor B &\mapsto \pi_x(b)
,\]
which is an isomorphism since
\[
g\cdot(x\tensor b) 
= y\tensor hb 
\mapsto \pi_y(hb) 
= g\cdot \pi_x(b)
.\]
:::

:::{.corollary title="?"}
If $G$ is a finite group, then for any $A\in \mods{G}$,
\[
H^{>0}(G; \ZZG \tensor_\ZZ A) = 0 
.\]
:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
We think of $A$ as a module for the trivial subgroup, and so
\[
H^n(G; \ZZG \tensor_\ZZ A) 
&\cong H^n(G, \Ind_1^G A) \\
&\cong H^n(G; \Coind_1^G A) && \text{by the lemma} \\
&= H^n(1; A) && \text{by Shapiro's lemma} \\
&= 0
,\]
for $n>0$, since these are the higher derived functors of taking fixed points, and everything is fixed by 1.

## Lie Algebra (Co)homology

:::{.remark}
Motivation and historical background: if $G$ is a Lie group, $G\in \Grp \intersect \Mfd(C^\infty)$, i.e. the group operations are smooth maps.
Usually these are real manifolds, they were introduced in the late 1800s by Sophus Lie who studied differential equations on such objects.
Taking the tangent space at the identity, we write $\lieg = T_e G$, which is a **Lie Algebra**.
Lie showed that this is isomorphic to the vector space of left $G\dash$invariant vector fields (1st order differential operators) on $G$, which enjoys a **bracket** operation:
\[
[X, Y](f) = X(Yf) - Y(Xf) && f\in C^{\infty }
.\]
This turns out to again be a 1st order operator, despite looking like it might be 2nd order.
This led to the study of abstract Lie algebras.

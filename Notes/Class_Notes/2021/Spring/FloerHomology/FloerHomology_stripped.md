### Description

"I am teaching a topics course about Heegaard Floer homology next semester. Heegaard Floer homology was defined by Peter Ozsváth and Zoltan Szabó around 2000. It is a package of powerful invariants of smooth 3- and 4-manifolds, knots/links and contact structures. Over the last two decades, it has become a central tool in low-dimensional topology. It has been used extensively to study and resolve important questions concerning unknotting number, slice genus, knot concordance and Dehn surgery. It has been employed in critical ways to study taut foliations, contact structures and smooth 4-manifolds. There are also many rich connections between Heegaard Floer homology and other manifold and knot invariants coming from gauge theory as well as representation theory. We will learn the basic construction of Heegaard Floer homology, starting with the definition of the 3-manifold and knot invariants. In the second half of this course, we will turn to computations and applications of the theory to low-dimensional topology and knot theory. In particular, several numerical invariants have been defined using this homological invariants. At the end of the semester, I would expect each one of you to learn the construction of one of these invariants (of course with my help) and present it to the class."

## Intro and Motivation

::: {.remark}
We'll assume everything is smooth and oriented.
:::

::: {.proposition title="Osvath-Szabo (2000)"}
To closed 3-manifolds \( M \) we can assign a graded abelian group \( \widehat{HF}(M) \), which can be computed combinatorially [^1] . There are several variants:

-   \( HF^- \in {\mathsf{grMod}}({\mathbb{Z}}_2[u]) \), [^2]

-   \( HF^+ \in {\mathsf{Mod}}({\mathbb{Z}}_2[u, u ^{-1} ] / u {\mathbb{Z}}_2[u]) \).

-   \( HF^\infty \in {\mathsf{grMod}}({\mathbb{Z}}_2[u, u ^{-1} ]) \),

\( HF^+ \) and \( HF^\infty \) can be computed using \( HF^- \). In general, we'll write \( HF^{-} \) to denote constructions that work with any of the above variants.
:::

::: {.remark}
Note that \( {\mathbb{Z}}_2 \) can be replaced with \( {\mathbb{Z}} \), but it's technical and we won't discuss it here. For the first half of the course, we'll just discuss \( \widehat{HF} \), and we'll discuss the latter 3 in the second half.
:::

## Geometric Information

::: {.remark}
These invariants can be used to compute the **Thurston seminorm** of a 3-manifold:
:::

::: {.definition title="Thurston Seminorm"}
A homology class \( \alpha\in H_2(M) \) can be represented as \( \alpha\in [S] \) for \( S \) a closed surface whose fundamental class represents \( \alpha \) where \( S = \bigcup_{i=1}^n S_i \) can be a union of closed embedded surfaces \( S_i \). Then we first compute
\[
\max\left\{{0, - \chi(S_i) }\right\} 
=
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } S_i \cong {\mathbb{S}}^2, {\mathbb{T}}^2 \\ 
\\
- \chi(S_i) = 2g(S_i) - 2  & \text{ else} .
\end{cases}
.\]
Note that the max checks if \( \chi \) is positive. Then define
\[
{\left\lVert { \alpha } \right\rVert} \coloneqq\min_S \qty{ \sum_{i=1}^n 
\max\left\{{0, - \chi(S_i) }\right\} }
,\]
where we sum over the embedded subsurfaces and check which overall surface gives the smallest norm.
:::

::: {.remark}
Note that this can't be a norm, since if \( {\mathbb{S}}^2, {\mathbb{T}}^2 \in [S] \implies {\left\lVert {\alpha } \right\rVert}= 0 \).
:::

::: {.theorem title="Osvath-Szabo"}
\( HF \) detects [^3] the Thurston seminorm, and there is a splitting as groups/modules
\[
HF^{-}(M) = \bigoplus _{\mathfrak{s} \in {\operatorname{Spin}}^c(M)} HF^{-}(M, S) 
\]
where \( S \in {\operatorname{Spin}}^c(M) \) is a **spin\( ^c \) structure**: an oriented 2-dimensional vector bundle on \( M \) (up to some equivalence).
:::

::: {.remark}
The Thurston norm \( {\left\lVert {a} \right\rVert} \) can be computed from this data by considering a perturbed version of \( \widehat{HF} \), denoted \( \underline{\widehat{HF}} \), in the following way: taking the first Chern class \( c_1(\mathfrak{s}) \in H^2(M) \) (which can be associated to every 2-dimensional vector bundle), we have
\[
{\left\lVert { \alpha} \right\rVert} = \max_{\underline{\widehat{HF}}(M, \mathfrak{s}  ) \neq 0 }
{\left\lvert {{\left\langle { c_1(\mathfrak{s})  },~{ \alpha } \right\rangle}  } \right\rvert}
.\]
:::

::: {.slogan}
Floer homology groups split over these spin\( ^c \) structures and can be used to compute Thurston norms.
:::

::: {.theorem title="Ni"}
Given \( F \subseteq M \) with genus \( g\geq 2 \), \( HF \) detects if \( M \) *fibers* over \( S^1 \) with \( F \) as a fiber, i.e. there exists a fiber bundle

```{=tex}
\begin{tikzcd}
F 
  \ar[r, hook] 
& 
M
  \ar[d, "\pi"] 
\\
& 
S^1 
\end{tikzcd}
```
This uses the existence of the splitting over spin\( ^c \) structures and uses \( HF^+ \) in the following way: such a bundles exists if and only if
\[
\bigoplus _{{\left\langle { c_1(\mathfrak{s}) },~{ [F] } \right\rangle}  =2g-2} HF^+(M, \mathfrak{s}) = {\mathbb{Z}}
.\]
:::

::: {.definition title="Contact Structure"}
Equivalently,

-   A smooth oriented nowhere integrable 2-plane field \( \xi \), or

-   A 2-plane field \( \xi \coloneqq\ker( \alpha) \) where \( \alpha \) is a 1-form such that \( \alpha\wedge d \alpha > 0 \). [^4]
:::

::: {.example title="?"}
The standard contact structure on \( {\mathbb{R}}^3 \) is given by
\[
\alpha\coloneqq dz - ydz
,\]
which yields the following 2-plane field \( \xi \coloneqq\ker \alpha \):

![2-Plane Field in \( {\mathbb{R}}^3 \)](figures/image_2021-01-18-23-04-19.png)

You can see that \( z=0 \implies y=0 \), so the \( xy{\hbox{-}} \)plane is in the kernel, yielding the flat planes down the middle:

![Flat Planes](figures/Flat_Planes.png)
:::

::: {.proposition title="Contact Class (Osvath-Szabo-Honda-Kazez-Matic)"}
To each such \( \xi \) one can associate a **contact class** \( c(\xi) \in \widehat{HF}(-M) \), where \( -M \) is \( M \) with the reversed orientation.
:::

::: {.remark}
This gives obstructions for two of the following important properties of contact structures:

-   Being **overtwisted**, or
-   Being **Stein fillable**.
:::

::: {.theorem title="?"}
```{=tex}
\envlist
```
-   If \( \xi \) is overtwisted, then \( c(\xi) = 0 \).
-   If \( \xi \) is Stein fillable, then \( c(\xi) \neq 0 \).
:::

::: {.remark}
We'll also discuss similar invariants for knots that were created after these invariants for manifolds.
:::

::: {.definition title="Knots"}
Recall that a **knot** is an embedding \( S^1 \hookrightarrow M \).

![Example: the trefoil knot](figures/image_2021-01-18-23-13-07.png){width="150px"}
:::

::: {.proposition title="Knot Floer Homology (Ozsváth-Szabó)"}
Given a knot \( K \subseteq M \) a 3-manifold (e.g. \( M = S^3 \)), there is extra algebraic structure on \( \widehat{CF}(M) \): a filtration. These allow defining a new bigraded abelian group \( \widehat{HFK}(M, K) \) (which is also a \( {\mathbb{Z}}_2{\hbox{-}} \)vector space) that takes includes the information of \( K \). This yields a decomposition
\[
\widehat{HFK}(M, K) = \bigoplus _{m, a} \widehat{HFK}_m(M, K, a)
.\]

This similarly works for other variants: there is a filtration on \( CF^-(M) \) which yields \( HFK^-(M, K) \), a bigraded \( {\mathbb{Z}}_2[u]{\hbox{-}} \)module.
:::

### Some properties of Knot Floer Homology

::: {.fact}
\( \widehat{HFK}(K) \) categorifies the Alexander polynomial \( \Delta_K(t) \) of \( K \), i.e. taking the graded Euler characteristic yields
\[
\Delta_K (t) =\sum_{m, a} (-1)^m\qty{ \dim \widehat{HFK}_m(K, a) } t^a
.\]
:::

::: {.fact}
\( \widehat{HFK}(K) \) detects the **Seifert genus** of a knot \( g(K) \), defined as the smallest \( g \) such that there exists an embedded surface [^5] \( F \) of genus \( g \) in \( S^3 \) that bounds \( K \), so \( {{\partial}}F = K \).

::: {.example title="The Unknot"}
The unknot bounds a disc, so its genus is zero:

![The genus of the unknot](figures/image_2021-01-18-23-29-23.png)
:::

::: {.exercise title="The Trefoil"}
Using the "outside" disc on the trefoil, find 3 bands that show its genus is 1.

![The genus of the trefoil](figures/image_2021-01-18-23-30-49.png)
:::

The genus can be computed by setting \( \widehat{HFK}(K, a) \coloneqq\bigoplus _m \widehat{HFK}_m(K, a) \), which yields
\[
g(k) = \max \left\{{ a {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}\widehat{HFK}(K, a) \neq 0 }\right\}
.\]
Note that the \( a \) grading here is referred to as the **Alexander grading**.
:::

::: {.fact}
\( \widehat{HFK} \) detects whether or not a knot is **fibered**, where \( K \) is fibered if and only if it admits an \( S^1 \) family \( F_t \) of Seifert surfaces such that \( t\neq s\in S^1 \implies F_t \cap F_s = K \). I.e., there is a fibration on the knot complement where each fiber is a Seifert surface:

```{=tex}
\begin{tikzcd}
\Sigma_g 
  \ar[r] 
& 
S^3\setminus K
  \ar[d, "\pi"] 
\\
& 
K 
\end{tikzcd}
```
::: {.example title="The Unknot"}
The unknot is fibered by \( {\mathbb{D}}^2 \)s:

![The unknot fibered by discs.](figures/image_2021-01-18-23-38-35.png)
:::

This is "detected" in the following sense: \( K \) is fibered if and only if
\[
\widehat{HFK}(k, g(K)) = {\mathbb{Z}}_2
.\]
:::

::: {.definition title="Slice Genus"}
Let \( K \subseteq S^3 \). We know \( S^3 = {{\partial}}B^4 \), so we consider all of the smoothly properly embedded surfaces \( F \) in \( B^4 \) such that \( {{\partial}}F = K \) and take the smallest genus:

![Knot in \( S^3 \) bounding a surface in \( B^4 \)](figures/image_2021-01-18-23-56-35.png)

We thus define the **slice genus** or **4-ball genus** as
\[
g_S(K) \coloneqq g_4(K) \coloneqq\min 
\left\{{
g(F) {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}F\hookrightarrow B^4 \text{ smootherly, properly with } {{\partial}}F = K
}\right\}
.\]
:::

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Show that \( g_4(K) \leq g(K) \).
:::

::: {.definition title="Unknotting number"}
Define \( u(K) \) the **unknotting number** of \( K \) as the minimum number of times that \( K \) must cross itself to become unknotted.
:::

::: {.example title="The Trefoil"}
Consider changing the bottom crossing of a trefoil:

![Changing one crossing in the trefoil](figures/image_2021-01-19-00-01-14.png)

This in fact produces the unknot:

![Unkink to yield the unknot](figures/image_2021-01-19-00-02-00.png)

Thus \( u(K) = 1 \), assuming that we know \( K \neq 0 \) is not the unknot.
:::

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Show that \( g_f(K) \leq u(K) \).

> Hint: each crossing change \( K\to K' \) yields some surface that is a cobordism from \( K \) to \( K' \) in \( B^4 \), and you can use each step to build your surface.

![Surface between \( K \) and \( K' \)](figures/image_2021-01-19-00-04-13.png)
:::

::: {.theorem title="Ozsváth-Szabó"}
Define an invariant \( \tau(K) \in {\mathbb{Z}} \) from \( \widehat{HFK} \) such that \( {\left\lvert {\tau(K)} \right\rvert} \leq g_4(K) \leq u(K) \).
:::

::: {.definition title="Torus Knots $T_{p, q}$ "}
Recall that we can view \( {\mathbb{T}}^2 \coloneqq{\mathbb{R}}^2/{\mathbb{Z}}^2 \) where the action is \( (x, y) \xrightarrow{(m, n)} (x+m, y+m) \), i.e. we module out by integer translations. Then for \$p, q \> 0 \$ coprime, \( T_{p, q} \) is the image of the line \( y = mx \) in \( {\mathbb{T}}^2 \) where \( m=p/q \).
:::

::: {.example title="$T_{2, 3}$ "}
The torus knot \( T_{2, 3} \) wraps 3 times around the torus in one direction and twice in the other:

![The torus knot \( T_{2, 3} \)](figures/image_2021-01-19-00-09-51.png)
:::

::: {.theorem title="Milnor"}
\[
g_4(T_{p, q}) = u(T_{p, q}) = { (p-1)(1-q) \over 2}
.\]

-   First proved by Kronheimer-Mrowka
-   Another proof by Osvath-Szabó using Heegard Floer homology.
:::

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Show that \( u(T_{p. q}) \leq {(p-1)(q-1) \over 2} \), i.e. torus knots can be unknotted with this many crossing changes.
:::

::: {.theorem title="Osvath-Szabó"}
\[
\tau(T_{p, q}) = 
{(p-1)(q-1) \over 2}
,\]

which implies
\[
{(p-1)(q-1) \over 2}
\leq g_4(T_{p, q})
\leq u(T_{p, q})
\leq {(p-1)(q-1) \over 2}
,\]
making all of these equal.
:::

::: {.remark}
There are better lower bounds for \( u(K) \) defined using \( \widehat{HFK} \) which are *not* lower bounds for the slice genus. There are also other lower bounds for the slice genus with different names (see Jen Hom's survey), some of which are stronger than \( \tau \).
:::

::: {.remark}
Another application of having these lower bounds is that we can construct exotic (or *fake*) \( {\mathbb{R}}^4 \)s, i.e. 4-manifolds \( X \) homeomorphic to \( {\mathbb{R}}^4 \) but not diffeomorphic to \( {\mathbb{R}}^4 \).
:::

::: {.remark}
All of these invariants work nicely in a \( (3+1){\hbox{-}} \)TQFT: we have invariants of 3-manifolds \( M_i \) and knots in them, so we can talk about **cobordisms** between them: \( W^4 \) a compact oriented 4-manifold with \( {{\partial}}W^4 = -M_1 {\coprod}M_2 \).

![A cobordism](figures/image_2021-01-19-00-24-31.png)

Osvath-Szabó define a map
\[
F_{W, t}^{-}: HF^{-}(M_1, { \left.{{t}} \right|_{{M_1}} } ) \to HF^{-}(M_2, { \left.{{t}} \right|_{{M_2}} })
\]
using \( t \) coming from the splitting of spin\( ^c \) structure which yields an invariant of closed 4-manifolds referred to as **mixed invariants**.

Similarly, if we have knots in 3-manifolds we can define a cobordism \( (M_1, K_1) \to (M_2, K_2) \) as \( (W^4, F) \) where \( W^4 \) is a cobordism \( M_1\to M_2 \) and \( F\hookrightarrow W \) is a smoothly embedded surface that is a cobordism from \( K_1\to K_2 \) with \( F \cap M_i = K_i \) and \( {{\partial}}F = -K_1 {\coprod}K_2 \).

![A cobordism including knots](figures/image_2021-01-19-00-29-04.png)

This similarly yields a map

\[
F_{W, F t}^{-}: HF^{-}(M_1, K_1, { \left.{{t}} \right|_{{M_1}} } ) \to HF^{-}(M_2, K_2, { \left.{{t}} \right|_{{M_2}} })
\]
:::

::: {.remark}
This smoothly embedded surface in the middle can be used to study other smoothly embedded surfaces in 4-manifolds, which has been done recently.

## Constructing Heegard Floer

::: {.remark}
For Morse Theory, there are some good exercises in Audin's book -- essentially anything other than the existence questions. The first 8 look good on p. 18.\

Today:

1.  Overview of the construction of HF, and

2.  A discussion of Morse Theory.

First goal: discuss how the name "Heegard" fits in.
:::

::: {.definition title="Genus $g$ handlebody"}
A **genus \( g \) handlebody** \( H_g \) is a compact oriented 3-manifold with boundary obtained from \( B^3 \) by attaching \( g \) solid handles (a neighborhood of an arc).
:::

::: {.example title="Attaching $g=2$ handles to a sphere"}
For \( g=2 \) attached to a sphere, we glue \( D^2 \times I \) by its boundary to \( S^2 \).

![image_2021-01-19-00-35-48](figures/image_2021-01-19-00-35-48.png)

In general, \( {{\partial}}H_g = \Sigma_g \) is a genus \( g \) surface, and \( H_g \setminus{\coprod}_{i=1}^g D_i = B^3 \). We can keep track of the data by specifying \( (\Sigma, \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \cdots, \alpha_g) \) where \( {{\partial}}D_i = \alpha_i \).

![Attaching a handlebody](figures/image_2021-01-19-11-26-35.png)
:::

::: {.definition title="Heegard Decomposition"}
A **Heegard diagram** is \( M = H_1 \cup_{{\partial}}H_2 \) where \( H_i \) are genus \( g \) handlebodies and there is a diffeomorphism \( {{\partial}}H_1 \to {{\partial}}H_2 \).
:::

::: {.theorem title="?"}
Every closed 3-manifold has a Heegard decomposition, although it is not unique.
:::

::: {.definition title="Heegard Diagram"}
A **Heegard diagram** is the data \( (\Sigma_g, \alpha = \left\{{ \alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_g}\right\}, \beta = \left\{{ \beta_1, \cdots, \beta_g}\right\}) \) where the \( \alpha \) correspond to \( H_1 \) and \( \beta \) to \( H_2 \) and \( \Sigma_g = {{\partial}}H_1 = {{\partial}}H_2 \).
:::

## Lagrangian Floer Homology

::: {.remark}
This is essentially an infinite-dimensional version of Morse homology.
:::

::: {.definition title="Symplectic Manifold"}
A **symplectic manifold** is a pair \( (M^{2n}, \omega) \) such that

-   \( \omega \) is *closed*, i.e. \( d \omega = 0 \), and
-   \( \omega \) is *nondegenerate*, i.e. \( \wedge^n \omega \neq 0 \).

::: {.definition title="Lagrangian"}
A **Lagrangian submanifold** is an \( L^n \subseteq M \) such that \( { \left.{{\omega}} \right|_{{L}} } = 0 \).
:::

::: {.remark}
If \( L_1 \cap L_2 \) is finitely many points, case we can define a chain complex
\[
CF(M^{2n}, L_1, L_2) \coloneqq{\mathbb{Z}}_2[L_1 \cap L_2]
,\]
the \( {\mathbb{Z}}_2{\hbox{-}} \)vector space generated by the intersection points of the Lagrangian submanifolds. We'll define a differential by essentially counting discs between intersection points:

![Two intersection points](figures/image_2021-01-19-11-46-38.png)

We'll want to write \( {{\partial}}x = c_y y + \cdots \) where \( c_y \) is some coefficient. How do we compute it? In this case, we have half of the boundary on \( L_1 \) and half is on \( L_2 \)

![i](figures/image_2021-01-19-00-40-08.png)

So we can the number of *holomorphic* discs from \( x \) to \( y \). We'll get \( {\partial}^2 = 0 \iff \operatorname{im}{\partial}\subset \ker {\partial} \), and \( HF \) will be kernels modulo images. In more detail, we'll have
\[
{{\partial}}x = \sum_y \sum_{\mu(\varphi) = 1} \# \widehat{\mathcal{M}} (\varphi)y &&  \widehat{\mathcal{M}}(\varphi) = \mathcal{M}(\varphi) / {\mathbb{R}}
\]
where \( \widehat{\mathcal{M}} \) will (in good cases) be a 1-dimensional manifold with finitely many points. Note that it's not necessarily true that \( CF \) has a grading!

Given a 3-manifold \( M^3 \), we'll associate a Heegard diagram \( \Sigma, \alpha, \beta \). Note the \( g{\hbox{-}} \)element symmetric group acts on \( \prod_{i=1}^g \Sigma \) by permuting the \( g \) coordinates, so we can define \( \operatorname{Sym}^g(\Sigma) \coloneqq\prod_{i=1}^g \Sigma / S_g \).
:::

::: {.theorem title="?"}
The space \( \operatorname{Sym}^g(\Sigma) \) is a smooth complex manifold of \( {\mathbb{R}}{\hbox{-}} \)dimension \( 2g \).
:::

::: {.remark}
Write \( {\mathbb{T}}_{\alpha} \coloneqq\prod_{i=1}^g \alpha_i \subseteq \prod_{i=1}^g \Sigma \) for a \( g{\hbox{-}} \)dimensional torus; this admits a quotient map to \( \operatorname{Sym}^g(\Sigma) \). We can repeat this to obtain \( {\mathbb{T}}_{\beta} \). Then \( HF^{-}(M) \) will be a variation of Lagrangian Floer Homology for \( (\operatorname{Sym}^g(\Sigma), {\mathbb{T}}_{\alpha}, {\mathbb{T}}_{\beta} ) \).

::: {.definition title="Dehn Surgery"}
Consider \( M \) a 3-manifold containing a knot \( K \), we can construct a new 3-manifold by first removing a neighborhood of \( K \) to yield \( M\setminus N(K) \):

![image_2021-01-19-12-23-16](figures/image_2021-01-19-12-23-16.png)

Taking a new solid torus \( S \coloneqq{\mathbb{D}}^2 \times S^1 \) and a diffeomorphism \( i: {{\partial}}S \to {{\partial}}(M \setminus N(K)) \), this yields a new manifold \( M _{\varphi} (K) \), a **surgery** along \( K \).

![image_2021-01-19-12-25-25](figures/image_2021-01-19-12-25-25.png)
:::

::: {.remark}
Note that the diffeomorphism is entirely determined by the image of the curve \( \alpha \) . The Knot Floer chain complex of \( K \) will allow us to compute any flavor \( HF^{-}M _{\varphi} (K) \) of Floer homology. Why is this important: any closed 3-manifold is surgery on a link in \( S^3 \). However there are many more computational tools available here and not in the other theories: combinatorial approaches to compute, exact sequences, bordered Floer homology.

# Lecture 3: Morse Theory (Thursday, January 19)

## Intro to Morse Theory

::: {.remark}
Let \( M^n \) be a smooth closed manifold, then the goal is to study the topology of \( M \) by studying smooth functions \( f \in C^ \infty (M, {\mathbb{R}}) \). We'll need \( f \) to be *generic* in a sense we'll discuss later.

:::

::: {.definition title="Critical Point"}
A point \( p\in M \) is called a **critical point** if and only if \( (df)_p = 0 \).
:::

::: {.definition title="Hessian / Second Derivative"}
Fixing a critical point \( p \) for \( f \), the **second derivative** or **Hessian** of \( f \) at \( p \) is a bilinear form on \( T_pM \) which is defined in the following way: for \( v, w\in T_p M \), extend \( w \) to a vector field \( \tilde w \) in a neighborhood of \( p \) and set
\[
d^2 f_p(v, w) = v\cdot (\tilde w \cdot f)(p) \coloneqq v \cdot (df)(\tilde w)(p)
.\]
where we take the derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( \tilde w \), then take the derivative with respect to \( v \), then evaluate at the point to get a number.
:::

::: {.remark}
This is only well-defined at critical points (check!). Note that we need \( \tilde w \) so that \( \tilde w \cdot f \) is again a function (and not a number) which can be differentiated again. You can also take e.g. \( \tilde v \cdot (\tilde w \cdot f) \), differentiating with respect to the vector field instead of just the vector \( v \), but we're plugging in \( p \) in either case.
:::

::: {.claim}
The second derivative is

1.  Well-defined, and

2.  Symmetric
:::

::: {.remark}
If you fix a coordinate chart in a neighborhood of \( p \), then the bilinear form is represented by a matrix given by
\[
(d^2 f)_p = H_p =  \qty{ {\frac{\partial ^2}{\partial x_j {\partial}x_i}\,}(p)}_{ij}
.\]
:::

::: {.proof title="of 2"}
We can compute
\[
(d^2 f)_p(v, w) - (d^2 f)_p(w, v) 
&= v\cdot (\tilde w \cdot f)(p) - w \cdot (\tilde v \cdot f)(p) \\
&\coloneqq df_p \qty{ [\tilde v, \tilde w]} \\
& = 0 && \text{since $p$ is a critical point and $df_p = 0$}
.\]
:::

::: {.proof title="of 1"}
This is now easier to prove: we are picking an extension of \( w \) to a vector field, so we need to show that the definition doesn't depend on that choice.
\[
(d^2 f)(_p(v, w) 
&= v\cdot (\tilde w \cdot f)(p) && \text{which doesn't depend on }\tilde v\\
&= (d^2 f)_p(w, v) \\
&= w\cdot (\tilde v \cdot f)(p) && \text{which doesn't depend on } \tilde w
,\]
and thus this is independent of both \( \tilde v \) and \( \tilde w \).
:::

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Show that the second derivative in local coordinates is given by the matrix \( H_p \) above.
:::

::: {.remark}
In local coordinates, we can write \( v = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i {\frac{\partial }{\partial x_i}\,} \) and \( w = \sum_{i=1}^n b_i {\frac{\partial }{\partial x_i}\,} \), and thus
\[
(d^2 f)_p(v, w) = \mathbf{b}^t H_p \mathbf{a} = \sum_{1 \leq i,j \leq n} a_i b_j {\frac{\partial ^2 f}{\partial x_i {\partial}x_j}\,}(p)
.\]
:::

::: {.definition title="Nondegenerate Critical Points"}
A critical point \( p\in M \) is called **nondegenerate** if the bilinear form \( (d^2 f)_p \) is nondegenerate at \( p \), i.e. for all \( v\in T_p M \) there exists a \( w\in T_pM\setminus\left\{{\mathbf{0}}\right\} \) such that \( (d^2 f)_p(v, w) \neq 0 \). This occurs if and only if \( H_p \) is invertible.
:::

::: {.definition title="Index of a critical point"}
Given a nondegenerate critical point \( p\in M \), define the **index** \( \operatorname{ind}(p) \) of \( f \) at \( p \) in the following way: since \( H_p \) is symmetric and nondegenerate, its eigenvalues are real and nonzero, so define the index as the number of *negative* eigenvalues of \( H_p \).
:::

::: {.definition title="Morse Function"}
A function \( f\in C^ \infty (M, {\mathbb{R}}) \) is called a **Morse function** if and only if all of its critical points are nondegenerate.
:::

::: {.remark}
We'll see that almost every smooth function is Morse, and these are preferable since they have a simple and predictable structure near critical points and don't do anything interesting elsewhere.
:::

::: {.theorem title="Morse Lemma"}
Let \( p\in M \) be a nondegenerate critical point of \( f \) with \( \operatorname{ind}(p) = \lambda \). Then there exists charts \( \varphi:(U, p) \to ({\mathbb{R}}^n, 0) \) such that writing \( f \) in local coordinates yields
\[
(f \circ \varphi ^{-1} )(x) = f(p) - \sum_{i=1}^{\lambda} x_i^2 + \sum_{j= \lambda + 1}^n x_j^2
.\]

Consider \( S^2 \) with a height function:

![Sphere with a height function](figures/image_2021-01-19-00-49-32.png)

Then we have a local minimum at the South pole \( p \) and a local max at the North pole \( q \), where \( \operatorname{ind}(p) = 0 \) and \( \operatorname{ind}(q) = 2 \). Note that the critical points essentially occur where the tangent space is horizontal
:::

Consider \( {\mathbb{T}}^2 \) with the height function:

![Torus with a height function](figures/image_2021-01-19-00-49-53.png)

This has a similar max/min as the sphere, but also has two critical points in the middle that resemble saddles:

Choose a metric \( g \) on \( M \), then the **gradient vector** of \( f \) is given by
\[
g(\nabla f, v) = df(v)
.\]
:::

::: {.remark}
We have
\[
df( \nabla f) = g(\nabla f, \nabla f) = {\left\lVert {\nabla f} \right\rVert}^2
.\]
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
We have the following situation:

![image_2021-01-21-12-11-16](figures/image_2021-01-21-12-11-16.png)

The gradient vector is always tangent to the level sets, so we can consider the curve \( \gamma \) which satisfies \( \dot\gamma(t) = -\nabla f( \gamma(t)) \):

![image_2021-01-21-12-12-42](figures/image_2021-01-21-12-12-42.png)

For technical reasons, we want to end up with cohomology instead of homology and will take \( -\nabla f \) instead of \( \nabla f \) everywhere:

![image_2021-01-21-12-13-35](figures/image_2021-01-21-12-13-35.png)

So \( \gamma \) will be a trajectory of \( - \nabla f \), and \( f ^{-1} [a, b] \cong f ^{-1} (a) \times[0, 1] \). A problem is that following these trajectories may involve arriving at \( f ^{-1} (a) \) at different times:

![image_2021-01-21-12-15-10](figures/image_2021-01-21-12-15-10.png)

We can fix this by normalizing:
\[
V \coloneqq- \nabla f / {\left\lVert { \nabla f} \right\rVert}^2 \implies (df)(v) = {\left\langle { \nabla f},~{ - \nabla f / {\left\lVert {\nabla f} \right\rVert}^2} \right\rangle} = -1
.\]

For every \( p \in f ^{-1} (b) \), if \( \gamma(t) \) is the trajectory starting from \( p \), i.e. \( \gamma(0) = p \), then \( \gamma(b-a) \in f ^{-1} (a) \). So define
\[
\Phi: f ^{-1} (b) \times[0, b-a] &\to f ^{-1} ([a, b]) \\
(p, t) &\mapsto \gamma_p (t)
,\]
which will be a diffeomorphism.

## Attaching Handles

Goal: we want to use Morse functions (smooth, nondegenerate critical points) to study the topology of \( M \). Recall that the torus had 4 critical points,

![image_2021-01-26-11-14-32](figures/image_2021-01-26-11-14-32.png)

We defined the index as the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. Here the highest index will be the dimension of the manifold, and by the Morse lemma the two intermediate critical points will be index 1.
:::

::: {.remark}
We want to use the Morse function to decompose the manifold, so we consider \( M_a \coloneqq f ^{-1} ((- \infty , a ]) \). If \( f ^{-1} [a, b] \) does not contain a critical point, then \( M_a \cong M_b \) and \( f ^{-1} (a) \cong f ^{-1} (b) \). So taking \( M_{1/2} \) and \( M_{3/4} \) here both yield discs:

![image_2021-01-26-11-17-46](figures/image_2021-01-26-11-17-46.png)

( \gamma(t), c) &\mapsto \gamma(t+c)
.\]
If \( p\neq q \), this action is free and we can thus quotient by it to obtain
\[
\mathcal{M}(p, q) \coloneqq\qty{ M^s(p) \cap M^u(q)} / {\mathbb{R}}
.\]
This identifies all points on the same trajectory, yielding one point for every trajectory, and so this is called the **moduli space of trajectories from \( p \) to \( q \)**.
:::

If \( \operatorname{ind}(p) = \operatorname{ind}(q) \), we have \( \dim M^u(p) \cap M^s (q) = 0 \), making \( \dim \mathcal{M}(p, q) = -1 \) and thus \( \mathcal{M}(p, q) = \emptyset \) and no gradient trajectories connect \( p \) to \( q \). Referring back to the example, since \( \operatorname{ind}(p_3) = \operatorname{ind}(p_2) \), if \( (f, g) \) were Morse-Smale then there would be no trajectory \( p_3 \to p_2 \), whereas in this case there is at least one.
:::

::: {.remark}
If \( \operatorname{ind}(p) - \operatorname{ind}(q) = 1 \), then \( \dim \mathcal{M}(p, q) = \operatorname{ind}(p) - \operatorname{ind}(q) - 1 = 0 \), making \( \mathcal{M}(p, q) \) a compact 0-dimensional manifold, which is thus finitely many points, meaning there are only finitely many trajectories connecting \( p\to q \) and it becomes possible to define a Morse complex.

# Morse Homology and Lagrangian Floer Homology (Thursday, January 28)

## Morse Homology

::: {.remark}
Last time: defined the Morse complex. Assumed \( (f, g) \) was a Morse-Smale pair, where \( f \) is a Morse function and \( g \) is a Riemannian metric, and this guarantees that if \( p, q\in \operatorname{crit}(f) \) with \( \operatorname{ind}(p) - \operatorname{ind}(q) = 1 \), then (among other things) there are finitely many gradient trajectories \( p\leadsto q \). We denoted this \( \mathcal{M}(p, q) \). The chain complex was defined by \( C_i(f, g) \coloneqq\bigoplus_{\operatorname{ind}(p) = i} {\mathbb{Z}}_2 \left\langle{ p }\right\rangle \) with differential \( {{\partial}}_i: C_i \to C_{i-1} \) was defined by sending an index \( i \) critical point \( p \) to \( \sum_{\operatorname{ind}(q) = i-1} \# \mathcal{M}(p, q) q \pmod 2 \).
:::

::: {.theorem title="The Morse Complex is a Chain Complex"}
\( {{\partial}}_{i} \circ {{\partial}}_{i+1} = 0 \).
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
Idea of the proof: we can directly compute
\[
{{\partial}}({{\partial}}p) 
&= {{\partial}}\qty{ \sum_{\operatorname{ind}(q) = i-1} \# \mathcal{M}(p, q) q } \\
&= \sum_{\operatorname{ind}(q) = i-1} \# \mathcal{M}(p, q) {{\partial}}q \\
&= \sum_{\operatorname{ind}(q) = i-1} \# \mathcal{M}(p, q) \qty{ \sum_{\operatorname{ind}(r) = i-2 \# \mathcal{M}(q, r) r  }}   \\
&= \sum_{\operatorname{ind}(r) = i-2} \qty{\sum_{\operatorname{ind}(q) = i-1} \# \mathcal{M}(p, q) \# \mathcal{M}(q, r) }  r \\
&= \sum_{\operatorname{ind}(r) = i-2} c_{p,q,r} r \\
&= 0 && \text{(claim)}
.\]

This happens if and only if \( c_{p, q, r} = 0 \pmod 2 \) for all \( r \) with \( \operatorname{ind}(r) = i-2 \). This is multiplication of the number of trajectories:

![image_2021-01-28-11-23-19](figures/image_2021-01-28-11-23-19.png)

In other words, this is the total number of trajectories \( p\leadsto r \) that pass through \( q \). These trajectories "break" at \( q \), and so we refer to these as **broken trajectories**.
:::

::: {.definition title="Broken Trajectories"}
Suppose \( \operatorname{ind}(r) = \operatorname{ind}(p) - 2 \), then a **broken trajectory** from \( p \) to \( r \) is a trajectory from \( p \) to \( q \) followed by a trajectory \( q \) to \( r \) where \( \operatorname{ind}(q) = \operatorname{ind}(p)-1 = \operatorname{ind}(r) + 1 \).

![image_2021-01-28-11-26-25](figures/image_2021-01-28-11-26-25.png)
:::

::: {.question}
Why is the number of broken trajectories even?
:::

::: {.answer}
We can check that \( \dim \mathcal{M}(p, r) = \dim \qty{ W^u(p) \pitchfork W^s(r)}/{\mathbb{R}}= (\operatorname{ind}(p) - \operatorname{ind}(r)) - 1 = 2-1 = 1 \). We can compactify \( \mathcal{M}(p, r) \) by adding in all of the broken trajectories to define
\[ 
\overline{\mathcal{M}(p, r)} \cup\qty{ \bigcup_{\operatorname{ind}(q) = i-1} \mathcal{M}(p, q) \times\mathcal{M}(q, r) } 
.\]
This is useful here because we can appeal to the classification of smooth compact 1-dimensional manifolds, which are unions of copies of \( S^1 \) and \( D_1 = I \). In particular, the number of boundary points
\[
{{\partial}}\overline{\mathcal{M}(p, r)} = \bigcup_{\operatorname{ind}(q) = i-1} \mathcal{M}(p, q) \times\mathcal{M}(q, r)
\]
is even:

![image_2021-01-28-11-32-34](figures/image_2021-01-28-11-32-34.png)
:::

::: {.example title="Morse Homology of the Torus"}
Suppose you have two critical points of the same index. The Morse-Smale condition implies that there's no trajectory between them. A counterexample would be \( p_3 \leadsto p_2 \) on the torus with the height function:

![image_2021-01-28-11-45-16](figures/image_2021-01-28-11-45-16.png)

However, if you perturb this slightly, the trajectories can be made to miss \( p_2 \) and end at \( p_1 \) instead. All of the trajectories are disjoint, so we end up with a situation like the following after perturbing the metric:

![image_2021-01-28-11-48-06](figures/image_2021-01-28-11-48-06.png)

We can cut along a curve on the bottom to better analyze these trajectories:

![image_2021-01-28-11-48-57](figures/image_2021-01-28-11-48-57.png) ![image_2021-01-28-11-50-27](figures/image_2021-01-28-11-50-27.png)

Now cut this cylinder along the trajectories \( p_1\leadsto p_3 \leadsto p_1 \), i.e. the green trajectories here:

![image_2021-01-28-11-51-31](figures/image_2021-01-28-11-51-31.png)

![image_2021-01-28-11-53-32](figures/image_2021-01-28-11-53-32.png)

Here we can see that as the trajectories approach the corners, they limit to broken trjacetories:

![image_2021-01-28-11-54-44](figures/image_2021-01-28-11-54-44.png)

We can compute

-   \( C_0 = {\mathbb{Z}}/2{\mathbb{Z}}\left\langle{ p_1 }\right\rangle \)
-   \( C_1 = {\mathbb{Z}}/2{\mathbb{Z}}\left\langle{ p_2, 3 }\right\rangle \)
-   \( C_2 = {\mathbb{Z}}/2{\mathbb{Z}}\left\langle{ p_4 }\right\rangle \)

Since there are exactly two trajectories \( p_4 \) to \( p_2 \) or \( p_3 \), we get \( {{\partial}}_2 = 0 \). Similarly \( {{\partial}}_1 = 0 \), and we get \( HM_i(T) = [{\mathbb{Z}}/2{\mathbb{Z}}, {\mathbb{Z}}/2{\mathbb{Z}}^2, {\mathbb{Z}}/2{\mathbb{Z}}, 0, \cdots] \), which is the same as its singular homology.
:::

::: {.theorem title="?"}
\[
HM_i(f, g) \cong H_i^{{\operatorname{Sing}}}(M; {\mathbb{Z}}/2{\mathbb{Z}})
.\]
In particular, it doesn't depend on the choice of Morse-Smale pair \( (f, g) \). See proof in references, e.g. Audin.
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
By definition, \( \# \operatorname{crit}_i(f) = \operatorname{rank}C_i(f, g) = \operatorname{rank}HM_i(f, g) \), and in any chain complex the rank of the chain groups are always at least the rank of the homology.
:::

## Lagrangian Floer Homology

::: {.remark}
Suppose \( L_0^n, L_1^n \subset M^{2n} \) are compact with \( L_0 \pitchfork L_1 \), so the intersection is finitely many points.

![image_2021-01-28-12-16-27](figures/image_2021-01-28-12-16-27.png)

We can do Morse theory on the space of paths between them:
\[
\mathcal{P}(L_0, L_1) \coloneqq\left\{{ \gamma: I\to M {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}\gamma(0) \in L_0, \gamma(1) \in L_1}\right\}
.\]

We'll find analogs of Morse functions on \( P(L_0, L_1) \) such that the critical points are constant paths, i.e. \( L_0 \cap L_1 \). The Morse inequalities then gives bounds on the number of intersection points between \( L_0 \) and \( L_1 \).
:::

::: {.definition title="Symplectic Manifolds"}
A **symplectic manifold** is a pair \( (M^{2n}, \omega) \) with \( \omega \) a 2-form which is

-   Closed, i.e. \( d \omega = 0 \), and
-   Nondegenerate, i.e. \( \bigwedge^n \omega \neq 0 \).
:::

::: {.definition title="Lagrangian Submanifolds"}
A half-dimensional submanifold \( L^n \subset M^{2n} \) is called **Lagrangian** if \( { \left.{{ \omega}} \right|_{{L^n}} } = 0 \).
:::

::: {.example title="?"}
The pair \( ({\mathbb{R}}^{2n}, \sum_{i=1}^n dx_i \wedge dy_i \) is a symplectic manifold (and also a symplectic vector space). Note that this 2-form is also a bilinear form of the following shape:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \operatorname{id}_n 
\\
-\operatorname{id}_n & 0
\end{bmatrix}
.\]

This has a Lagrangian submanifold \( {\mathbb{R}}^n \coloneqq\left\{{y_1 = \cdots = y_n = 0}\right\} \).

> Note: See Darboux theorem.
:::

::: {.remark}
The general setup for next time: we'll have \( (M^{2n}, \omega) \) a symplectic manifold, a pair \( L_0, L_1 \subset M \) such that \( L_0 \pitchfork L_1 \), and we want to do Morse Homology on \( \mathcal{P}(L_0, L_1) \).
:::

# Lecture 6 (Tuesday, February 02)

::: {.remark title="Setup"}
We're working with a symplectic manifold, i.e. a pair \( (M^{2n}, \omega) \) where \( \omega \in \Omega^2 \) is closed, i.e. \( d \omega = 0 \), and nondegenerate, i.e. \( \bigvee^n \omega \neq 0 \). We were also consider \( L^n_0, L^n_1 \subset M \) Lagrangian submanifolds, i.e. \( { \left.{{ \omega }} \right|_{{L_i}} } = 0 \). The goal is to do something like Morse homology on \( \mathcal{P}(L_0, L_1) \) where the critical points corresponds to intersection points \( L_0 \cap L_1 \), where we'll assume \( L_0 \pitchfork L_1 \).
:::

::: {.question}
What is the analog of a Morse function?
:::

::: {.remark}
The functional \( f \) is defined on the *universal cover* \( \overline{\mathcal{P}}(L_0, L_1) \to {\mathbb{R}} \). We can get around knowing much about \( f \) because we only ever need derivatives \( df \) and a metric \( g \) on the path space to talk about the gradient \( \nabla_g f \). We'll define a 1-form \( \alpha: T \mathcal{P}(L_0, L_1) \to {\mathbb{R}} \), where we can define this tangent space as \( T_{\gamma} \mathcal{P}(L_0, L_1) \) where \( \gamma(s): I \to M \). Set \( u(s, t) \) to be a path from \( \gamma \) to \( \gamma' \) where \( u(s, 0) = \gamma \) and \( u(s, 1) = \gamma' \) and \( {\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\,}\Big|_{t=0} \), which is a tangent vector to \( \gamma \) and thus \( {\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\,}(s, 0) \in T_{\gamma(s)}M \).

![image_2021-02-02-11-29-54](figures/image_2021-02-02-11-29-54.png)

Upshot: tangent vectors in \( T_{\gamma} \mathcal{P}(L_0, L_1) \) are given by \( \xi(s) \in T_{\gamma(s)}M \) for every \( s \in I \), i.e. a way to push the path off of itself to obtain a new path.

We can thus define
\[
\alpha: T\mathcal{P}(L_0, L_1) &\to {\mathbb{R}}\\
( \gamma, \xi \in T_{\gamma} \mathcal{P}) &\mapsto \alpha_{\gamma}{\xi} \coloneqq\int_0^1 \omega( \dot{\gamma}(s), \xi(s)) ds
.\]
Does this have the property we want? I.e. is it zero when \( \gamma \) is the constant path?
:::

::: {.lemma title="?"}
\[
\alpha _{\gamma} \equiv 0 \iff \gamma(s) \text{ is constant} \iff \dot{ \gamma(s)} = 0 \text{ for all } \gamma \iff \gamma(s) \in L_0 \cap L_1
.\]
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
\[
\alpha _{\gamma} \equiv 0 \iff \int_0^1 \omega( \dot{\gamma}(s), \xi(s)) ds = 0 \text{ for all } \xi\not\equiv 0
.\]

::: {.claim}
If \( \dot{\gamma}(s) \neq 0 \) for some \( s \) then this is also true in an open neighborhood by smoothness, so one can find a \( \xi \) such that

-   \( \omega( \dot{\gamma(s)}, \xi(s) ) \geq 0 \), and
-   There is some open subinterval \( (a, b) \subseteq [0, 1] \) on which \( \xi \) is nonzero, and thus the integral is strictly positive.
:::

We'll need a few tools:

::: {.definition title="Almost Complex Structure"}
An **almost complex structure** is a bundle automorphism \( J: TM\to TM \) such that \( J \circ J = - \one_{TM} \). It is said to be **compatible** with \( \omega \) if and only if

-   Positivity: For every \( v\neq 0 \), \( \omega(v, Jv) > 0 \).
-   "Symplectic Isometry": For all \( v, w \in TM \), \( \omega(Jv, Jw) = \omega(v, w) \).

In this case, there is a Riemannian metric defined by \( g(v, w) = \omega(v, Jw) \). Conversely, given an almost complex structure \( J \) and a metric \( J \), there is a symplectic form defined by \( \omega(v, w) = \omega(Jv, Jw) \coloneqq g(Jv, w) \).

```{=tex}
\todo[inline]{This may not be a closed form? Need to check later!}
```
:::

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Check that \( \omega \) is a symplectic form compatible with \( J \) and \( g \) is the corresponding metric.
:::

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Given a symplectic form \( \omega \) and a Riemannian metric \( g \) there exists a canonical almost complex structure \( J \) compatible with \( \omega \) such that the previous process sends \( (\omega, J) \) to \( g \).
:::

::: {.corollary title="?"}
Any symplectic manifold \( (M, \omega) \) has a compatible almost complex structures \( J \).
:::

::: {.theorem title="?"}
The space of all almost complex structures on \( M \) compatible with \( \omega \) is contractible.
:::

Here we can use that \( \xi(s) = J \dot{ \gamma}(s) \) which implies \( \omega( \dot{\gamma}(s), J \dot{\gamma(s)}) = \omega( \dot{ \gamma(s)}, \xi(s) ) > 0 \), which happens if and only if \( \dot{ \gamma}(s) \neq 0 \).

So pick an almost complex structure compatible with \( \omega \) and produce a metric \( g \). We'll define a metric on \( \mathcal{P}(L_0, L_1) \) by the following: for \( \xi, \eta \in T_{\gamma} \mathcal{P} \), recalling that \( \xi = \xi(s), \eta = \eta(s) \in T_{\gamma(s)}M \), set
\[
g_{\gamma}^\mathcal{P}( \xi, \eta) \coloneqq\int_0^1 g( \xi(s), \eta(s) ) ds = \int_0^1 \omega(\xi, J \eta) ds
.\]

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Check that \( g^\mathcal{P} \) is a metric on \( \mathcal{P}(L_0, L_1) \).
:::

We'll now define a **gradient vector field**:
\[
g_{\gamma}^\mathcal{P}( -\nabla, {-}) = \alpha({-})
.\]
So here \( \alpha \) will play the role of \( -df \). We can write
\[
\int_0^1 \omega( - \nabla, J \xi) ds = \int_0^1 \omega( \cdot{\gamma}, \xi) ds
.\]
Using compatibility, the LHS is equal to
\[
\cdots = \int_0^1 \omega(-J \nabla, J^2 \xi) ds 
= \int_0^1 \omega(J \nabla, \xi) ds
.\]
So the RHS is equal to this for every \( \xi \), which means that \( J \nabla= \dot{\gamma} \). Multiplying both sides by \( J \) yields \( \nabla= -J \dot{\gamma} \) What are the trajectories of \( J \cdot{ \gamma}(s)\in T_{\gamma} \mathcal{P} \)? We can compute
\[
{\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\,} (s, t) = J {\frac{\partial u}{\partial s}\,}(s, t)
.\]
Here \( t \) is the parameter that moves between paths, and \( s \) moves along a given path:

# Lecture 7 (Thursday February 04)

## Lagrangian Floer Homology

::: {.remark}
Recall that we had a symplectic manifold \( (M^{2n}, \omega) \) with \( L_0, L_1 \subset M \) two Lagrangians. We wanted to do something like Morse theory on \( \mathcal{P}(L_0, L_1) \).

![image_2021-02-16-22-21-44](figures/image_2021-02-16-22-21-44.png)

What ingredients do we need?

-   Something to replace \( -df \): \( \alpha \)

-   Something to replace the vector field \( -\nabla \): we defined a metric \( g^\mathcal{P} \) using \( \alpha \)

To define \( \alpha \) we needed to look at
\[
T_{ \gamma} \mathcal{P}= \left\{{ \xi: I\to TM {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}\xi(s) \in T_{\gamma(s)}M }\right\} 
,\]
which is like a collection of tangent vectors along \( \gamma \) giving a way to deform the path. Since \( \alpha\in \Omega^1(\mathcal{P}) \), for any \( \gamma \) it induces a map
\[
T_{ \gamma} M &\xrightarrow{\alpha} {\mathbb{R}}\\
\xi &\mapsto \alpha_{ \gamma} (\xi) \coloneqq\int_0^1 \omega( \dot{ \gamma}, \xi)\,ds
.\]
:::

::: {.observation}
\( \alpha_{ \gamma} = 0 \iff \gamma \) is constant, which happens if and only if \( \gamma\in L_0 \cap L_1 \). This corresponds to critical points of the functional yielding intersection points of the Lagrangians.
:::

::: {.remark}
We wanted to define the gradient, for which we needed a metric on \( \mathcal{P} \). We did this by lifting a metric from \( M \). Pick an almost complex structure \( J \) compatible with \( \omega \), then this yields a Riemannian metric defined by \( g(v, w) = \omega(v, Jw) \). Then we can define
\[
g^\mathcal{P}_{\gamma}(\xi, \eta) \coloneqq\int_0^1 g( \xi(s), \eta(s) )\,ds
.\]
We used this to compute the vector field \( -\operatorname{grad}_{\gamma} J \cdot{\gamma}(s) \). What are its trajectories? These are paths of paths \( u(s, t) \coloneqq u_t(s) \) such that \( {\frac{\partial }{\partial t}\,} u_t(s) = J {\frac{\partial }{\partial s}\,} u_t \). We thus get an equation
\[
{\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\,}(s, t) = J {\frac{\partial u}{\partial s}\,}(s, t)
.\]
:::

::: {.remark}
For \( x, y \in L_0 \cap L_1 \) trajectories connecting \( x \) to \( y \), we'll write this as
\[
\mathcal{M}(x, y) \coloneqq\left\{{ 
u(s, t) :[0,1] \times{\mathbb{R}}\to M 
\substack{ 
  u(0, t) \in L_0 \\ 
  u(1, t) \in L_1 \\ 
  u(s, t) \overset{t\to - \infty }\to x \\ 
  u(s, t) \overset{t\to \infty }\to y \\
  {\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\,} = J {\frac{\partial u}{\partial s}\,}
} 
}\right\} 
.\]

We can modify this PDE to make things look familiar: multiply both sides with \( J \) to obtain
\[
J {\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\,} = J^2 {\frac{\partial u}{\partial s}\,} \implies
J {\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\,} = - {\frac{\partial u}{\partial s}\,} \implies
{\frac{\partial u}{\partial s}\,} + J {\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\,} = 0
,\]
which is the Cauchy-Riemann equation.
:::

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Check that this equation can be written as \( J\, du = du \circ i \) where \( i \) is the standard complex structure on \( {\mathbb{C}}\supseteq [0, 1] \times{\mathbb{R}} \), so \( du \) commutes with \( i \) and \( J \).
:::

::: {.definition title="$J\\dash$holomorphic or Pseudoholomorphic Discs"}
If \( J\, du = du \circ i \), then \( u \) is called a **\( J{\hbox{-}} \)holomorphic disc** or a **pseudoholomorphic disc**.

Schematically, the situation is the following:

![image_2021-02-16-23-22-40](figures/image_2021-02-16-23-22-40.png)

Using the Riemann mapping theorem, the strip on the left-hand side is biholomorphic to \( {\mathbb{D}}\subseteq {\mathbb{C}} \) with \( \pm i \) removed:

![image_2021-02-16-23-23-43](figures/image_2021-02-16-23-23-43.png)

Due to the limit conditions at infinity in the strip, we can extend \( u \) to a \( J{\hbox{-}} \)holomorphic map from the entire disc by sending \( i\mapsto y \) and \( -i\mapsto x \).
:::

::: {.remark}
In Morse homology, we have an \( {\mathbb{R}} \) action on the moduli space of trajectories, and that also shows up here. Here \( {\mathbb{R}}\curvearrowright\mathcal{M}(x, y) \) by \( u(s, t) \xrightarrow{c} u_c(s, t) \coloneqq u(s, t+c) \), noting that translating the strip from above still yields a solution.

.\]
:::

::: {.remark}
When is the intersection count \( \# \widehat{\mathcal{M}}(x, y) \) well-defined? In Morse homology, we have two conditions:

1.  \( (f, g) \) is Morse-Smale, to ensure that the moduli spaces are smooth manifolds (using Sard's theorem)

2.  \( \operatorname{ind}(x) - \operatorname{ind}(y) = 1 \), ensuring \( \mathcal{M}(x, y) \) is 1-dimensional

3.  Compactness of \( \widehat{\mathcal{M}}(x, y) \) when 1 and 2 hold.

These were enough to guarantee that \( \widehat{ \mathcal{M}} (x, y) \) was a smooth compact 0-dimensional manifold, which allowed for point counts. In Lagrangian Floer homology, we have the following replacements:

**For 2 (indices)**: Recall that the index in Morse homology was the dimension of the negative eigenspace of the Hessian, but we're in infinite dimensions here. So we won't have a well-defined index, but we'll have something that can replace the *difference* of indices: the **Maslov index** \( \mu(x, y) \), the expected dimension of \( \mathcal{M}(x, y) \). To actually have this be the dimension will require some conditions, so it's not always true. This will be the index of some elliptic operator defined using the Cauchy-Riemann equations.

**For 1 (transversality)**: We'll need some version of transversality, which will imply that for a generic \( J \) that \( \mathcal{M}(x, y) \) is smooth.

**For 3 (compactness)**: We'll use **Gromov compactness** and some extra topological assumptions, which will imply that \( \widehat{ \mathcal{M}}(x, y), \mathcal{M}(x, y) \) are both compact.

Taken together, these will make the point-count well-defined.

One example of Lagrangian Floer homology is **Heegard Floer homology**. We'll want some symplectic manifold with two Lagrangian submanifolds. Oszvath-Szabo used a 2-dimensional description of closed 3-manifolds called **Heegard diagrams**. We'll need Heegard splittings to define these, and handlebodies to define the splittings.

A **handlebody** of genus \( g \) will mean a compact 3-manifold obtained from \( {\mathbb{B}}^3 \) by attaching \( g \) solid 1-handles, i.e. \( {\mathbb{D}}^1 \times{\mathbb{D}}^2 \). These are glued in via two copies of \( {{\partial}}{\mathbb{D}}^1 \times{\mathbb{D}}^2 \):

![image_2021-02-16-19-36-51](figures/image_2021-02-16-19-36-51.png)

Alternatively, these can be defined as a regular neighborhood of \( \bigvee_{i=1}^g S^1 \subset {\mathbb{R}}^3 \). We'll write \( H_g \) for a genus \( g \) handlebody, and \( {{\partial}}H_g \) will be a genus \( g \) surface.

Explicitly, we have
\[
H_1 {\coprod}_{ \varphi} H_2 \coloneqq{ H_1 {\coprod}H_2 \over \left\langle{ x \sim \varphi(x) {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}\forall x \in {{\partial}}H_1 }\right\rangle }

::: {.example title="?"}
We can write \( S^3 = B_3 {\coprod}_{\one} B^3 \), where both are just genus \( 0 \) handlebodies. Note that if you attach a solid 1-handle to \( B^3 \), this yields \( S^1 \times{\mathbb{D}}^2 \), i.e. a solid torus:

![image_2021-02-16-19-42-43](figures/image_2021-02-16-19-42-43.png)

Think of \( S^3 \) as the one-point compactification of \( {\mathbb{R}}^3 \), we can write (and visualize) a decomposition \( S^3 = (S^1 \times{\mathbb{D}}^2) {\coprod}_{\varphi} (S^1 \times{\mathbb{D}}^2) \). The first copy will be a neighborhood of a circle in the plane:

![image_2021-02-16-19-44-16](figures/image_2021-02-16-19-44-16.png)

Labeling this circle as \( H^1 \coloneqq\left\{{ x^2 + y^2 = 1, z = 0}\right\} \), the complement \( H_2 \coloneqq S^3 \setminus H_1 \) will be a regular neighborhood of the \( z{\hbox{-}} \)axis union \( \left\{{\infty }\right\} \):

:::

::: {.example title="?"}
We can write a Heegard splitting of \( S^1 \times S^2 \).

This yields two solid torii glued along their boundaries.
:::

::: {.theorem title="?"}
Any closed 3-manifold \( M^3 \) admits a Heegard splitting.
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
A fact from Morse theory: there exists a Morse function \( f: M^3\to {\mathbb{R}} \) such that

1.  \( f(p) = i \coloneqq\operatorname{ind}(p) \) for every \( p\in \operatorname{Crit}(f) \) (i.e. \( f \) is **self-indexing**), and

2.  \( f \) has exactly one index \( 0 \) (minimum) and one index \( 3 \) (maximum) critical point.

We thus have the following situation:

![image_2021-02-16-19-51-11](figures/image_2021-02-16-19-51-11.png)

The remaining critical points must occur at 2 and 3:

![image_2021-02-16-19-52-00](figures/image_2021-02-16-19-52-00.png)

How can we break this into smaller manifolds? Any time we pass a critical point, we attach a one-handle. Note that we can define a new Morse function \( h \coloneqq 3-f \) Suppose we have \( g \) critical points of index 1 for \( f \) and \( g' \) critical points of index 1 for \( h \).

-   We can check that \( f ^{-1} [0, 1/2] = {\mathbb{B}}^3 \) and \( f ^{-1} (1/2) = S^2 \).

-   \( f ^{-1} [0, 3/2] \Lambda_g, \) a genus \( g \) handlebody, and thus \( f ^{-1} (3/2) = \Sigma_g \) will be a genus \( g \) surface.

    ![image_2021-02-16-19-54-58](figures/image_2021-02-16-19-54-58.png)

-   Repeating the above arguments for \( h \), we get \( f ^{-1} [0, 3/2] = g ^{-1} [3/2, 3] = \Lambda_{g'} \).

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Show that \( \operatorname{crit}(f) = \operatorname{crit}(h) \) and if \( p\in \operatorname{crit}(f) \) with \( \operatorname{ind}_f(p) = i \) then \( \operatorname{ind}_h(p) = 3-i \).
:::

Thus \( g' \) is the number of index 2 critical points for \( f \). This means that \( {{\partial}}h ^{-1} [0, 3/2] = h ^{-1} (3/2) = f ^{-1} (3/2) \) has genus \( g=g' \), and thus the \( \# \operatorname{crit}(f)_{\operatorname{ind}=1} = \# \operatorname{crit}(h)_{\operatorname{ind}=2} = g \). Even without this, we still have our two handlebodies: \( H_1 \coloneqq f ^{-1} [0, 3/2] \) and \( H_2 \coloneqq f ^{-1} [3/2, 3] \) glued over \( \Sigma_g \coloneqq f ^{-1} (3/2) \), which is a genus \( g \) splitting surface.
:::

::: {.definition title="Equivalence of Heegard Splittings"}
We'll say that two Heegard splittings \( M = H_1 {\coprod}_{\varphi} H_2 \) and \( M = H_1' {\coprod}_{\varphi} H_2 ' \) are **isotopic** if and only if there exists an ambient isotopy \( \psi: M \times[0, 1] \to M \) such that \( { \left.{{\psi}} \right|_{{M \times\left\{{ 1}\right\} }} }(H_i) = H_i ' \) for each \( i \). Recall that *ambient isotopy* means

-   \( { \left.{{\psi}} \right|_{{ M \times\left\{{ 0 }\right\} }} } = \one \),

-   \( { \left.{{ \psi }} \right|_{{M \times\left\{{ t }\right\} }} } \) is a homeomorphism.

No! We can distinguish them by the genus of the splitting surface \( \Sigma \), and we just saw two splittings of \( S^3 \), one with genus 0 and one with genus 1.
:::

::: {.remark}

:::

::: {.definition title="Stabilization"}
Given a genus \( g \) Heegard splitting \( M = H_1 {\coprod}_{ \varphi} H_2 \), we can produce a genus \( g+1 \) splitting \( M = H_1' \cup_{ \varphi} H_2' \) where

\( H_1' = H_1 \cup\overline{ \eta( \gamma) } \), where the new piece is a closed regular neighborhood of an unknotted arc \( \gamma \) in \( H_2 \). Here *unknotted* means that \( \gamma \) is a properly embedded arc in \( H_2 \cup\Sigma \) whose boundary is in \( \Sigma \) which bounds a contractible disc:

![image_2021-02-16-21-00-33](figures/image_2021-02-16-21-00-33.png)

Note that adding a regular neighborhood around \( \gamma \) has the effect of adding a 1-handle to \( H_1 \). We can then define \( H_2' \coloneqq H_2 \setminus\eta{\gamma} \). Why is this still a handlebody? We have this situation:

![image_2021-02-16-21-04-24](figures/image_2021-02-16-21-04-24.png)

We have the disc below the 1-handle, and if we thicken it to \( {\mathbb{D}}^2 \times I \), we have \( B \coloneqq\eta(\gamma) \cup({\mathbb{D}}^2 \times[0, 1] \cong {\mathbb{B}}^3 \):

![image_2021-02-16-21-07-07](figures/image_2021-02-16-21-07-07.png)

We then have \( H_2' \coloneqq(H_2 \setminus B) \cup({\mathbb{D}}^2 \cup[0, 1] ) \), and in fact there is something in the intersection of these two terms. The parts that are attached to \( H_2 \) are the front and back discs \( {\mathbb{D}}^2 \times\left\{{0, 1}\right\} \):

![image_2021-02-16-21-07-50](figures/image_2021-02-16-21-07-50.png)

So we can identify this as \( H_2' \coloneqq(H_2 \setminus B) {\coprod}_{{\mathbb{D}}^2 \times\left\{{ 0, 1 }\right\} } ({\mathbb{D}}^2 \cup[0, 1] ) \). Note that \( H_2 \setminus B \cong_{C^\infty} H_2 \) are diffeomorphic, and the right-hand side is a 1-handle. To see why this is, consider attaching the middle red part, and then pushing the center part away in order to see the handle:

:::

::: {.proposition title="Handlebody from a Heegard Diagram"}
Given a surface and a set of attaching curves, so the data of \( (\Sigma, \left\{{ \gamma_1, \cdots, \gamma_g }\right\} ) \) , we can build a handlebody \( H \). Note that we can go the other way: given a genus \( g \) handlebody \( H \), we can take \( \Sigma = {{\partial}}H \) and find \( g \) attaching circles.

**The recipe:**

1.  Thicken \( \Sigma \) to \( \Sigma \times[0, 1] \) to get a 3-manifold with 2 boundary components, \( \Sigma\times\left\{{ 1 }\right\} \) and \( \Sigma \times\left\{{ 2 }\right\} \).

2.  Attach thickened discs \( \gamma_i \times\left\{{ 0 }\right\} \) for each \( i \), yielding some \( S^2 \) boundary components.

3.  Fill the \( S^2 \) boundary component with a \( {\mathbb{B}}^3 \).

This yields a genus \( g \) handlebody \( H \) such that \( {{\partial}}H = \Sigma_g \times\left\{{ 1 }\right\} \), where the curves \( \left\{{ \gamma_1 \times\left\{{ 1 }\right\} , \cdots, \gamma_g \times\left\{{ 1 }\right\} }\right\} \).

Last time we saw that \( M_3 = H_1 {\coprod}_{\varphi} H_2 \) as two handlebodies glued along their boundary by a diffeomorphism \( \varphi: {{\partial}}H_1 \to {{\partial}}H_2 \). This is referred to as a **Heegard splitting** for \( M \). We can specify a genus \( g \) handlebody as \( ( \Sigma, \left\{{ \gamma_1, \cdots \gamma_g }\right\} \) where \( \Sigma\setminus\left\{{ \gamma_1, \cdots, \gamma_g }\right\} \) is connected and each \( \gamma_i \) bounds a disc in \( H \).

![image_2021-02-11-11-15-56](figures/image_2021-02-11-11-15-56.png)

Moreover, we can go backwards: given such data, we can build a handlebody \( H \) by

1.  Thickening \( \Sigma \) to obtain \( \Sigma \times[0, 1] \) This yields \( {{\partial}}( \Sigma \times[0, 1] ) = (\Sigma\times\left\{{0}\right\} ) {\coprod}(\Sigma\times\left\{{1}\right\} ) \).

2.  Attach thickened discs to \( \gamma_i \times\left\{{0}\right\} \). This makes the boundary \( (\Sigma \times\left\{{1}\right\} ) {\coprod}S_2 \)

Given a self-indexing Morse function \( f:M \to {\mathbb{R}} \) with exactly one index 0 and one index 3 critical point, pick a generic metric \( g \) so that \( (f, g) \) is a Morse-Smale pair (so the stable and unstable submanifolds intersect transversally). Taking \( - \nabla f \), we can obtain a Heegard diagram The stable submanifolds are codimension of their indices, so e.g. for each index critical point there is a 2-dimensional stable submanifold that intersects the next submanifold in a curve:

![Stable submanifold](figures/image_2021-02-11-11-36-23.png)

This occurs for (say) the \( g \) critical points of index \( 1 \) here, and since they are distinct critical points the stable submanifolds are disjoint. So we can obtain a set of attaching circles for the bottom handlebody \( f ^{-1} ([0, 3/2]) \):
\[
\left\{{ M^s(p) \cap f ^{-1} (3/2) {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}p \in \operatorname{crit}(f),\, \operatorname{ind}(p) = 1 }\right\}

where \( M^3 = H_{ \alpha} \coprod_{ \Sigma} H_ \beta \) and \( g \) is the genus of \( HD \). We refer to \( \Sigma \) as a **Heegard surface**, and this set of data as a **Heegard diagram**.

We'll define \( \operatorname{Sym}^g( \Sigma) \) by letting \( S_g \curvearrowright\Sigma^{\times g} \) where if \( \varphi\in S_g \) we set \( \varphi(x_1, \cdots, x_g) = x_{ \varphi(1)}, \cdots, x_{ \varphi(g) } \). Then set \( \Sigma^{\times g} \coloneqq\Sigma^{\times g} / S_g \). Why does this yield a smooth manifold? Is this action free? The diagonal \( D \subseteq \Sigma^{\times g} \) consists of the points with at least 2 equal coordinates, and it's easy to see that \( S_g\curvearrowright D \) can not be free. However, this still yields a smooth submanifold!
:::

::: {.lemma title="?"}
\( \operatorname{Sym}^g(\Sigma) \) is smooth, and any complex structure \( j \) on \( \Sigma \) will induce a complex structure on the quotient, denoted \( \operatorname{Sym}^g(j) \), which is unique in the sense that the quotient map \( \Sigma^{\times g} \xrightarrow{\pi} \operatorname{Sym}^g(\Sigma) \) is holomorphic.
:::

::: {.proof title="?"}
We'll check this locally, and then leave it as an exercise to check that it extends globally -- this is easy by just considering what happens under transition functions and checking that \( \pi \) is holomorphic. Locally we want to produce a map
\[ 
\operatorname{Sym}^g({\mathbb{C}}) &\xrightarrow{f} {\mathbb{C}}^g \\
\left\{{ z_1, \cdots, z_g }\right\} &\mapsto \qty{ 
  \prod_{i=1}^g (z-z_i) 
  = z^g +a_1 z^{g-1} + \cdots + a_g \mapsto [a_1, \cdots, a_g] 
}
.\]
This is a bijection, and by the fundamental theorem of algebra, there is an inverse. Equip \( \operatorname{Sym}^g({\mathbb{C}}) \) with a complex structure that makes \( f \) biholomorphic, then \( \operatorname{Sym}^g(j) \) is the complex structure locally equal to this one. This structure is obtained by just pulling back the standard complex structure \( i\times i \times\cdots i \) on \( {\mathbb{C}}^g \).
:::

::: {.remark}
\( \operatorname{Sym}^g( \Sigma) \) is a complex manifold of complex dimension \( g \) (or real dimension \( 2g \)). We want to find half-dimensional submanifolds to do Lagrangian-Floer homology. Using the Heegard splitting, write \( {\mathbb{T}}_ \alpha \coloneqq\prod_{i=1}^g \alpha_i \subset \Sigma^{\times g} \), which is a \( g{\hbox{-}} \)dimensional torus such that \( {\mathbb{T}}_ \alpha \cap D = \emptyset \) since the \( \alpha_i \) are pairwise disjoint. Composing the inclusion above with \( \pi \), we can note that the action of \( S^g \) is free away from the diagonal \( D \), so this composition is an embedding \( {\mathbb{T}}_ \alpha \hookrightarrow\operatorname{Sym}^g( \Sigma) \). Similarly, \( {\mathbb{T}}_ \beta\coloneqq\prod_{i=1}^g \beta_i \hookrightarrow\operatorname{Sym}^g( \Sigma) \).

Note that we're only working with complex structures now, and haven't upgraded it to a symplectic structure yet. But we don't really need this to count holomorphic discs. Lagrangians \( L \) were defined as submanifolds where \( { \left.{{\omega}} \right|_{{L}} } = 0 \), how do we do this without a symplectic form?
:::

::: {.definition title="?"}
Given a complex manifold \( (X, J) \), a submanifold \( L \subseteq X \) is **totally real** if none of its tangent spaces contains a complex line, i.e. \( T_p L \cap J(T_p L) = \left\{{ p, \mathbf{0} }\right\} \) for all \( p\in L \).

![image_2021-02-16-11-49-52](figures/image_2021-02-16-11-49-52.png)

Here any tangent vector has to get rotated out of the tangent space: if it were an eigenvector for \( J \), then the rank of \( J \) would be too low, contradicting its definition. Note that any 1-dimensional submanifold of \( (\Sigma, j ) \) is totally real, and so \( {\mathbb{T}}_ \alpha, {\mathbb{T}}_ \beta \) are also totally real submanifolds of \( \Sigma^{\times g} \). If you restrict \( \pi \) to \( \Sigma^{\times g}\setminus D \xrightarrow{\pi} \operatorname{Sym}^g(\Sigma) \setminus\pi(D) \), this yields a biholomorphic map.

We'll write \( \Delta \coloneqq\pi(D) \subseteq \operatorname{Sym}^g( \Sigma) \). Note that if \( \alpha\pitchfork\beta \), then \( {\mathbb{T}}_ \alpha \pitchfork{\mathbb{T}}_ \beta \). Any intersection point \( x \in {\mathbb{T}}_{\alpha} \cap{\mathbb{T}}_{\beta} \) is of the form \( x = \left\{{ x_1, \cdots, x_g}\right\} \subseteq \Sigma \) such that each \( \alpha_i, \beta_j \) contain exactly one of the coordinates of \( x \).

Today: topology of symmetric product spaces \( \operatorname{Sym}^g \). We had an assignment
\[
( \Sigma_g, \alpha, \beta) &\mapsto ( \operatorname{Sym}^g( \Sigma), {\mathbb{T}}_ \alpha, {\mathbb{T}}_ \beta)
,\]
where if \( \alpha, \beta \) are all transverse then so far \( {\mathbb{T}}_ \alpha, {\mathbb{T}}_ \beta \), since e.g. \( {\mathbb{T}}_ \alpha = \prod_{i=1}^g \alpha_i \). We wanted to define a chain complex

where \( \mu \) is the *Maslov index* and we want to count holomorphic discs. We'll first talk about continuous (topological) discs.
:::

::: {.lemma title="?"}
\[
\pi_1( \operatorname{Sym}^g( \Sigma ) ) \cong H_1 ( \operatorname{Sym}^g( \Sigma ) ) \cong H_1 (\Sigma)

:::

::: {.remark}
For a proof of the first isomorphism, see Lemma 2.6 in [@OSZ04a]. Idea of proof for the second isomorphism: we'll define a map
\[
\iota: H_1 ( \Sigma) &\to H_1( \operatorname{Sym}^g( \Sigma) ) \\
x &\mapsto \left\{{ x, z, \cdots, z }\right\} 
,\]
for some fixed \( z \in \Sigma \), along with its inverse. Note that we're identifying an embedding \( \iota( \Sigma ) = \Sigma \times\left\{{ z }\right\}^{\times g-1} \subseteq \operatorname{Sym}^g( \Sigma) \). Now define \( j \coloneqq\iota_* \) the induced map on homology.
\[
j: H_1( \operatorname{Sym}^g (\Sigma) ) \to H_1 ( \Sigma) \\
.\]
Picking a loop \( \gamma: S^1 \to \operatorname{Sym}^g( \Sigma ) \), note that \( \Delta\subset \operatorname{Sym}^g( \Sigma) \) has codimension 2, and so we can perturb \( \gamma \) to be disjoint from \( \Delta \). We can arrange so that \( \gamma \) is the union of \( g \) paths \( \gamma_1, \cdots, \gamma_g \) such that each \( \gamma_i \) connects \( x_i \in \gamma(0) \) to \( x_{ \sigma(i) } \in \gamma(0) \) where \( \gamma_0 = \left\{{ x_1, \cdots, x_g }\right\} \) and \( \sigma\in S_g \) is a permutation.

::: {.example title="?"}
For example, for \( g=3 \):

![image_2021-02-18-11-30-51](figures/image_2021-02-18-11-30-51.png)

Then \( \left\{{ \gamma_1(t), \gamma_2(t), \gamma_3(t) }\right\} \) is a loop from \( \gamma(0) \to \gamma(0) \in \operatorname{Sym}^3( \Sigma) \).
:::

This means that \( \bigcup_{i=1}^g \gamma_i \) is a 1-cycle in \( \Sigma \), and thus \( [ \cup g_i ] \in H_1( \Sigma) \). So we'll define this as \( j([ \gamma ]) = [ \cup\gamma_i ] \).

Let \( M \coloneqq\left\{{ (\mathbf{x}, y) {~\mathrel{\Big|}~}\mathbf{x} \in \operatorname{Sym}^g( \Sigma), y\in \mathbf{x} }\right\} \), then we'll define a \( g:1 \) branched cover away from \( \pi ^{-1} \Delta \) that yields a fiber bundle:

Then consider the quotient \( \Sigma / \tau \). To identify this quotient, since the top half is identified with the bottom half, we can first forget about the bottom half, and then forget about half of the arcs along the axis of rotation:

![image_2021-02-18-12-01-41](figures/image_2021-02-18-12-01-41.png)

Note that this results in a copy of \( S^2 \). We can define a map
\[
\Sigma &\to \Sigma^{\times g} \\
x &\mapsto (x, \tau(x), z, \cdots, z)

This extends to a map to \( \operatorname{Sym}^g( \Sigma) \), since \( \tau(x) \mapsto (\tau(x), x, z, \cdots, z) \) and these will be equal in \( \operatorname{Sym}^g \). So we can factor this through the quotient from above:

## Whitney Discs

::: {.remark}
For \( x,y \in {\mathbb{T}}_{ \alpha} \cap{\mathbb{T}}_{ \beta} \), recall that we had the following situation:

![Whiteney Disc](figures/image_2021-02-23-11-14-22.png)

Then \( \pi_2(x, y) \) was defined to be the homotopy classes of discs connecting \( x \) to \( y \). The obstruction to the existence of such discs was denoted \( \varepsilon(x, y) \in H_1(M) \) for \( M\in {\mathsf{Mfd}}^3 \). We're checking if there exist two paths connecting \( x \) to \( y \),
\[
a: I &\to {\mathbb{T}}_{ \alpha} \\
b: I &\to {\mathbb{T}}_{ \beta}
\]
such that \( a-b \) is nullhomotopic. In this case, \( \pi_2(x, y) \neq \emptyset \).

![image_2021-02-23-11-17-30](figures/image_2021-02-23-11-17-30.png)

We had a theorem that \( \pi_1(\operatorname{Sym}^g \Sigma) \cong H_1( \operatorname{Sym}^g \Sigma) \), so we can replace nullhomotopic with nullhomologous above. We can also use the fact that \( H_1( \operatorname{Sym}^g \Sigma) \cong H_1 \Sigma \). Note that \( [a-b] \) isn't well-defined, since we can append any loop to \( a \) for example, but the following is well-defined:
\[
\varepsilon(x, y) 
\coloneqq[a-b] \in { H_1 \operatorname{Sym}^g \Sigma \over H_1 {\mathbb{T}}_{ \alpha} \oplus H_1 {\mathbb{T}}_{ \beta} }
\cong {H_1 \Sigma \over \left\langle{ [ \alpha_1], \cdots, [ \beta_1 ], \cdots }\right\rangle} 
\cong H_1 M 
.\]

How can we compute \( \varepsilon \) using the Heegard diagrams? Recall that a path in \( \operatorname{Sym}^g \Sigma \) was a union of \( g \) paths in \( \Sigma \). So choose arcs \( a_1 \cup\cdots \cup a_g \) on \( \Sigma \) such that \( a_i \subseteq \alpha_i \) is sub-arc and \( {{\partial}}( a_1 \cup\cdots \cup a_g ) = y_1 + \cdots + y_g - x_1 - \cdots - x_g \), and similarly choose \( b_1 \cup\cdots \cup b_g \). Note that if \( \varepsilon(x, y) \neq 0 \) then \( \pi_2(x, y) = \emptyset \).
:::

::: {.example title="$L(2, 3)$"}
The following is a Heegard diagram for \( L(2, 3) \) of minimal genus, where we take \( \alpha \) to be the horizontal line and \( \beta \) will be a line of slope \( 2/3 \):

![image_2021-02-23-11-28-10](figures/image_2021-02-23-11-28-10.png)

Then \( {\mathbb{T}}_{ \alpha} \cap{\mathbb{T}}_{ \beta} = \left\{{ A, B }\right\} \). Now draw arcs connecting \( A \) and \( B \), e.g. the ones in orange and green here:

![image_2021-02-23-11-29-54](figures/image_2021-02-23-11-29-54.png)

Note that we have two generators of homology for the torus, say \( x,y \), and we can write

![image_2021-02-23-11-30-37](figures/image_2021-02-23-11-30-37.png)

Then the union of the two arcs is exactly \( x+y \), so we can write
\[
H_1( L(2, 3)) 
= { {\mathbb{Z}}\left\langle{ x, y }\right\rangle \over \left\langle{ y, 2x + 3y }\right\rangle}

Applying a rotation by \( \pi \) and taking the quotient, we get a 2-fold branched cover of \( S^1 \):

![image_2021-02-23-11-59-29](figures/image_2021-02-23-11-59-29.png)

Here \( x_1, x_2 \mapsto -i \) and \( y_1, y_2 \mapsto +i \). We can now get a map \( \varphi \) to \( \operatorname{Sym}^2( \Sigma) \):

![image_2021-02-23-12-01-02](figures/image_2021-02-23-12-01-02.png)

In the image we get 2 points with multiplicity on \( \Sigma \), and thus an element of \( \operatorname{Sym}^2 \Sigma \). We know \( \varphi(-i) = \left\{{ x_1, x_2 }\right\} \) and \( \varphi(+i) = \left\{{ y_1, y_2 }\right\} \).

We want to make a similar 2-fold cover like in the previous example, so we'll take the two rectangles bounding the arcs, then taking the rotation by \( \pi \) yields the cover:

![image_2021-02-23-12-20-27](figures/image_2021-02-23-12-20-27.png)

![image_2021-02-23-12-22-36](figures/image_2021-02-23-12-22-36.png)

As a result, we again get \( \varphi(-i) = \left\{{ x_1, x_2 }\right\} \) and \( \varphi(+i) = \left\{{ y_1, y_2 }\right\} \).

## Whitney Discs

::: {.remark}
Recall that we discussed the domains of discs: for \( \varphi\in \varphi_2(x, y) \) we defined the 2-chain \( D( \varphi) = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i D_i \) where we've written
\[ 
\Phi \setminus\alpha\cup\beta = {\coprod}_{i=1}^m \overset{\circ}{D_i} 
\]
and \( a_i \) is the number of points in \( \operatorname{im}( \varphi) \cap L_{z_i} \) for \( z_i \in D_i \).
:::

::: {.exercise title="?"}
For \( \varphi\in \pi_2(x, y) \), \( {{\partial}}D( \varphi) \) is a 1-chain in \( \alpha \cup\beta \). Then
\[ 
{ \left.{{ {{\partial}}D( \varphi )}} \right|_{{ \alpha}} } = \sum_{i=1}^g y_i - \sum_{i=1}^g x_i 
{ \left.{{ {{\partial}}D( \varphi )}} \right|_{{ \beta}} } = \sum_{i=1}^g x_i - \sum_{i=1}^g y_i 
\]
where \( x_i, y_i \in \alpha_i \).
:::

::: {.corollary title="?"}
For \( \varphi\in \pi_2(x, y) \), consider an intersection point \( w \) which labels 4 nearby regions with coefficients \( a,b,c,d \):

![image_2021-02-25-11-28-01](figures/image_2021-02-25-11-28-01.png)

Consider several cases:

1.  \( w\not\in x \) and \( w\not\in y \): Then \( {{\partial}}\qty{ {{\partial}}{ \left.{{D( \varphi)}} \right|_{{ \alpha}} } } \not\ni w \). We can expand this out as
    \[
      D( \varphi) = a D_1 + bD_2 + c D_3 + dD_4 \\
      {{\partial}}^2 D( \varphi) = {{\partial}}\qty{ a {{\partial}}D_1 } + {\cdots} 
      .\]
    Now restrict this to \( \alpha_i \) to yield
    \[
      {{\partial}}^2 D( \varphi) = ae_1 + be_2 -ce_2 -de_1
      .\]
    Checking coefficients of \( w \) contributes \( -aw + bw - cw -d(-w) \), and these should sum to zero. This yields \( a+c = b+d \), and similarly if \( w\cap x \cap y \), this also yields \( a+c = b+d \).

2.  \( w\in x \) and \( w\not \in y \) implies that \( a+c = b +d +1 \).

3.  \( w\not\in x \) and \( w\in y \) implies \( a+c+1 = b+d \).
:::

::: {.remark}
So if you want to check to see if some 2-chain could be the domain of a Whitney disc, this local condition can be checked, i.e. this is an obstruction to existence. It turns out that this is an if and only if condition.
:::

::: {.definition title="?"}
A 2-chain \( A \coloneqq\sum_{i=1}^m a_i D_i \) **connects** \( x \) to \( y \) if and only if the following local linear conditions are satisfied:
\[
{{\partial}}^2 { \left.{{A}} \right|_{{ \alpha}} } &= y-x \\
{{\partial}}^2 { \left.{{A}} \right|_{{ \beta}} } &= x-y \\
.\]
:::

::: {.proposition title="?"}
Suppose \( g>1 \). If a 2-chain \( A \) connects \( x \) to \( y \) then there exists a Whitney disc \( \varphi\in \pi_2(x, y) \) such that \( D( \varphi) = A \). If \( g>2 \), \( \varphi \) is uniquely determined by \( A \).

Set the coefficients of the unlabeled regions to zero, and let \( x \coloneqq\left\{{ x_1, x_2}\right\} \) and \( y \coloneqq\left\{{ y_1, y_2 }\right\} \). We can check that if the following yellow region has coefficient 1, it can be the domain of a Whitney disc:

![image_2021-02-25-11-47-15](figures/image_2021-02-25-11-47-15.png)

This follows from checking the local conditions (there is a mnemonic involving the diagonal sums for the various cases).

Is there a Whitney disc connecting \( x \coloneqq\left\{{ x_1, x_2 }\right\} \xrightarrow{\varphi} y \coloneqq\left\{{ y_1, y_2 }\right\} \)? Checking the diagonals, all of the local conditions hold, so yes.

Ultimately these are what we want to define the differential in the chain complex.

We'll set up a correspondence:
\[
\left\{{\substack{
  (\text{Riemann surfaces } F, {\color{red} {{\partial}}_{ \alpha}}F, {\color{blue}{{\partial}}_{\beta}}F)
  \xrightarrow{\pi_{\Sigma}} ( \Sigma, {\color{red} \alpha}, {\color{blue} \beta }) \\
  {\big\Downarrow} \hspace{4em} {\scriptsize \text{$g{\hbox{-}}$fold branched cover $\pi_D$} } \\

  \pi_D( {{\partial}}_{ \alpha} ) = e_1 \hspace {2em}

\left\{{\substack{

u: (D^2, e_1, e_2) \to (\operatorname{Sym}^g(\Sigma), {\mathbb{T}}_{ \alpha}, {\mathbb{T}}_{ \beta})

\]

To do this, we define \( u(z) = \pi_{\Sigma}( \pi_D ^{-1}(z) ) \in \operatorname{Sym}^g(\Sigma) \). Check that if \( \pi_D, \pi_\Sigma \) are holomorphic, then \( u \) is holomorphic.

Then if \( u \) is holomorphic, it can be shown that \( \pi_D, \pi_{\Sigma} \) are also holomorphic. Given \( \varphi\in \pi_2(x, y) \), define \( \mathcal{M}( \varphi) \) to be the moduli space of holomorphic discs connecting \( x \) to \( y \) in the same homotopy class as \( \varphi \) (i.e. such discs *represent* \( \phi \)). After perturbing the complex structure \( \operatorname{Sym}^g(j) \) to make it generic, \( \mathcal{M}( \varphi) \) will be smooth. We'll have a notion of dimension, the *Maslov index* \( \mu( \varphi) \), which is the expected dimension of \( \mathcal{M}( \varphi) \). There will be an \( {\mathbb{R}}{\hbox{-}} \)action on \( \mathcal{M}( \varphi) \), where we remember the biholomorphism between the disc and the vertical strip:

![image_2021-02-25-12-19-15](figures/image_2021-02-25-12-19-15.png)

We'll define \( \widehat{ \mathcal{M}}( \varphi) \coloneqq\mathcal{M}( \varphi) / {\mathbb{R}} \). The chain complex will be defined as
\[
\operatorname{HF}( \Sigma, \alpha, \beta) &\coloneqq\bigoplus_{x \in {\mathbb{T}}_{ \alpha} \cap{\mathbb{T}}_{ \beta} } {\mathbb{Z}}/2 \left\langle{ x }\right\rangle 
\\
{{\partial}}x &\coloneqq\sum_{y\in {\mathbb{T}}_{ \alpha} \cap{\mathbb{T}}_{ \beta} } \sum _{ \varphi\in \pi_2(x, y) ?} \# \widehat{ \mathcal{M}}(\varphi)  
.\]

We'll need

-   Check that \( {{\partial}} \) is well-defined and \( {{\partial}}^2=0 \),

-   Check independence of choices, e.g. the Heegard the diagram, the complex structure, the perturbations of \( \operatorname{Sym}^g(j) \), etc.
:::

::: {.question}
This takes a lot of work! Is the homology of this complex interesting? Is this stronger than singular homology?
:::

::: {.answer}
Let \( M \in \operatorname{ZHS}^3 \), so the homology doesn't distinguish \( M \) from a sphere and \( H_*(M; {\mathbb{Z}}) \cong H_*(S^3; {\mathbb{Z}}) \). It turns out that \( H_*( \operatorname{HF}(M^3)) \cong H_*(\operatorname{HF}(S^3)) \), so the answer is no!
:::

::: {.remark}
Osvath-Szabo picked a basepoint \( z\in \Sigma\setminus\qty{ \alpha\cup\beta} \) and work with *pointed* Heegard diagrams \( (\Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z) \). Perturb the differential to obtain
\[
\tilde {{\partial}}x \coloneqq\sum_{y \in {\mathbb{T}}_{ \alpha} \cap{\mathbb{T}}_{ \beta} } 
\sum_{ \substack{ 
\varphi \in \pi_2(x, y), \\
\mu( \varphi) = 0, \\
n_z( \varphi) = 0
}} 
\# \widehat{\mathcal{M}}(\varphi) y 
.\]
where \( n_z \) denotes the coefficient of \( \phi \) at the basepoint \( z \), i.e. the number of intersection points \( \# (\operatorname{im}\varphi \cap L_z) \).

Defining \( \widehat{\operatorname{HF}} \) as the same chain complex with the new differential now gets interesting! We'll define \( \widehat{\operatorname{HF}} \) as the homology of this new complex.

# The Heegard-Floer Chain Complex & Maslov Index (Tuesday, March 02)

## Pointed Heegard Diagrams

::: {.remark}
Last time: to strengthen the homology theory, take a **pointed** Heegard diagram \( (\Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z \in \Sigma\setminus\alpha\cup\beta \) and define a new chain complex
\[
\widehat{\operatorname{HF}}( \Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z) 
&= \bigoplus_{ x\in {\mathbb{T}}_ \alpha \cap{\mathbb{T}}_ \beta} {\mathbb{Z}}/2 \left\langle{ x }\right\rangle \\
{{\partial}}x &= \sum_{y \in {\mathbb{T}}_ \alpha \cap{\mathbb{T}}_ \beta} 
\sum_{ \substack{ 
  \varphi\in \pi_2(x, y), \\
  \mu( \varphi) = 1, \\
  n_z(\varphi) = 0
}} \# \widehat{ \mathcal{M}}(\varphi) y 
.\]
Note that \( n_z( \varphi) = 0 \) means that the coefficient attached to the region containing \( z \) is zero. Recall that we had diagram moves, how do they translate to the pointed setting?

-   Allow *pointed isotopies*, which are isotopies disjoint from \( z \).
-   Allow *pointed handleslides*, where now the bounded pair-of-pants is disjoint from \( z \):

![image_2021-03-02-11-18-40](figures/image_2021-03-02-11-18-40.png)

-   Allow isotopies of the base point.
:::

::: {.lemma title="?"}
Any two pointed Heegard diagrams for a 3-manifold \( M^3 \) can be connected by a sequence of the following moves:

-   Stabilization or destabilization,
-   Pointed isotopy,
-   Pointed handleslides,
-   Isotopes of the basepoint away from \( \alpha, \beta \).
:::

Prove this lemma.

Here is the simplest Heegard diagram from \( S^3 \):

![image_2021-03-02-11-22-54](figures/image_2021-03-02-11-22-54.png)

Here there is just one one intersection point, so \( \widehat{\operatorname{HF}} = {\mathbb{Z}}/2\left\langle{ x }\right\rangle \) is 1-dimensional, and \( {{\partial}}x = 0 \). So \( \widehat{\operatorname{HF}} = {\mathbb{Z}}/2 \).
:::

::: {.example title="$\\RP^3$"}
We can write \( {\mathbb{RP}}^3 = L(2 ,1) \) and produce the following Heegard diagram:

![image_2021-03-02-11-38-42](figures/image_2021-03-02-11-38-42.png)

Is there a disc between \( x \) and \( y \)? We can check the obstruction \( \varepsilon(x, y) \) by labeling the generators in homology and tracing the following green path:

![image_2021-03-02-11-40-13](figures/image_2021-03-02-11-40-13.png)

We obtain
\[
\varepsilon(x, y) = [B] \in { H_1(T^2) \over \left\langle{ [\alpha] = [A], [\beta] = [A + 2B] }\right\rangle }
.\]
In this quotient, \( [B] \neq 0 \), and this quotient is \( {\mathbb{Z}}/2 = \left\langle{ [B] }\right\rangle \) so that \( 2B = 0 \). So there are no disks in \( \pi_2(x, y) \), making \( {{\partial}}x = {{\partial}}y = 0 \). So \( \widehat{HF}({\mathbb{RP}}^3) = {\mathbb{Z}}/2 \oplus {\mathbb{Z}}/2 \).
:::

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Compute \( \widehat{\operatorname{HF}}(L(p, 1)) \). Use that \( \varepsilon(x, y) + \varepsilon(y, z) = \varepsilon(x, z) \).

## Maslov Index

::: {.remark}
Recall that we had a natural concatenation operation on Whitney discs:
\[
\ast: \pi_2(x, y) \times\pi_2(y, z) \to \pi_2(x, z)
,\]
using the identification of these discs with paths in the path space and using concatenation of paths there. Note that the domains of concatenations are given by \( D( \varphi_1 \ast \varphi_2) = D( \varphi_1) + D( \varphi_2) \), since this amounts to adding algebraic intersection numbers.

There is an inverse
\[
\pi_2(x, y) &\to \pi_2(y, x)\\
\varphi &\mapsto \varphi^{-1}(s, t) \coloneqq\phi(s, -t)
,\]
which reverses the parameterization on \( (s, t) \in I \times{\mathbb{R}} \) and runs the path backward. Here \( D( \varphi^{-1}) = -D( \varphi) \).

There is also a *sphere addition*
\[
\pi_2( \operatorname{Sym}^g( \Sigma), x) \times\pi_2(x, y) &\to \pi_2(x, y) \\
(\Omega, \varphi) &\mapsto \Omega \ast \varphi
.\]

![Maps entire boundary to a point, yielding a sphere.](figures/image_2021-03-02-12-04-06.png)

Note that for \( g\geq 2 \), the \( \pi_2 \) on the left-hand side is isomorphic to \( {\mathbb{Z}} \), which came from quotienting by the hyperelliptic involution several lectures ago. Writing the positive generator as \( S \), we have \( \Omega = kS \) for some \( k\in {\mathbb{Z}} \).

There exists a function \( \mu: \pi_2(x, y) \to {\mathbb{Z}} \) called the **Maslov index** satisfying:

1.  Additivity: \( \mu( \varphi_1 \ast \varphi_2) = \mu( \varphi_1) + \mu (\varphi_2) \).

2.  Invertibility: \( \mu( \varphi^{-1}) = - \mu( \varphi) \).

3.  Sphere addition: \( \mu( kS \ast \varphi) = \mu( \varphi) + 2k \) where \( k\in {\mathbb{Z}} \) and \( S\in \pi_2( \operatorname{Sym}^g( \Sigma ) ) \).

4.  If \( \varphi\in \pi_2(x, x) \) is constant, then \( \mu( \varphi) = 0 \).

Note that \( 2\implies 4 \).
:::

::: {.remark}
The Maslov index is the "expected" dimension of
\[
\mathcal{M}( \varphi) = \left\{{ 
u: I \to {\mathbb{R}}\to \operatorname{Sym}^g( \Sigma)
{~\mathrel{\Big|}~}
[u] = \varphi 
\,du\circ i = J \circ \,du
}\right\} 
\]
where \( i \) is the standard complex structure on the strip and \( J \) will be a perturbation of the complex structure over the Heegard surface. This will yield an operator
\[
\mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu{\partial}\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu_J: B &\to \mathcal{L} \\
u & \mapsto du \circ i - J \circ du 
\]
for some appropriate infinite dimensional spaces. The elements of \( \mathcal{M}( \varphi ) \) will be in the kernel of this operator. We want 0 to be a **regular value** (surjective derivative) for \( \mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu{\partial}\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu_J \), since in finite dimensions the inverse image would be a smooth manifold. In the infinite dimensional setting, we'll have by the inverse function theorem that \( \mathcal{M} (\phi) = \mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu{\partial}\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu^{-1}_J(0) \) will be a smooth manifold. We'll want the following derivative to be surjective:
\[
D_u \mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu{\partial}\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu_J: T_u B \to T_{\mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu{\partial}\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu_J u} \mathcal{L} 
\]
for all \( u \in \mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu{\partial}\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu^{-1}_J(0) \), which is referred to as **transversality** of the operator, and can be made to hold by perturbing the complex structure. Since the dimension of a manifold is the dimension of the tangent spaces, we'll have \( \mathcal{M}( \varphi) \) smooth of dimension equal to \( \dim \ker D_u \mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu{\partial}\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu_J \) for any \( u \in \mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu{\partial}\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu_J^{-1}(0) \). This will be an order 2 elliptic operator (or more generally a Fredholm operator), for which we have a notion of index:
\[
\operatorname{ind}( D \mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu{\partial}\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu_J) = \dim( \ker D\mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu{\partial}\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu_J) - \dim (\operatorname{coker}D \mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu{\partial}\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu_J)
.\]
If surjectivity holds, the cokernel will be zero, so it will suffice to compute the dimension of the kernel to get the dimension of the moduli space. The index of this operator will be the Maslov index.

# Maslov Index Formula (Thursday, March 04)

## Review

::: {.remark}
Recall that for \( x,y \in {\mathbb{T}}_ \alpha \cap{\mathbb{T}}_ \beta \), there is a map
\[
\mu: \pi_2(x, y) &\to {\mathbb{Z}}\\
&\mu &= \operatorname{ind}(D \mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu{\partial}\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu_J)
.\]

This index is the expected dimension of \( M(\varphi) \). The following theorem can be found in the paper "A cylindrical reformulation of Heegard Floer homology":
:::

::: {.theorem title="Lipschitz"}
Let \( x = \left\{{ x_1, \cdots, x_g }\right\} \) and \( y = \left\{{ y_1, \cdots, y_g }\right\} \) and \( \varphi\in \pi_2(x, y) \). Then
\[
\mu( \varphi) = e( D( \varphi) ) + n_x( D( \varphi ) ) + n_y( D( \varphi ) )
.\]
where \( e({-}) \) is the **Euler measure** and \( n_x(\cdots), n_y(\cdots) \) is referred to as the **point measure**. Note that these only depend on the domain of \( \varphi \).
:::

::: {.definition title="Euler Measure"}
Let \( D( \varphi) = \sum_{i=1}^m n_{z_i} ( \varphi) D_i \), then
\[
e (D (\varphi)) \coloneqq\sum_{i=1}^m n_{z_i}( \varphi) e(D_i) && e(D_i) \coloneqq\chi(D_i) + {1\over 4} C_1 - {1\over 4}C_2
.\]
Here we use the fact that all regions are polygons whose corners occur in one of two types:

![image_2021-03-04-11-20-25](figures/image_2021-03-04-11-20-25.png)

So we define \( C_1 \) to be the number of corners of the first type and \( C_2 \) the number of the second type. The point measure is defined as
\[
n_x (D( \varphi ) ) \coloneqq\sum_{i=1}^g n_{x_i}( D( \varphi ) ) = {n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_4 \over 4}

Let \( x = \left\{{ x_1, x_2 }\right\}, y = \left\{{ y_1, y_2 }\right\} \) and compute \( \mu( \varphi) \) where \( D( \varphi) \) is one of the following domains:

1.  The first type:

![image_2021-03-04-11-26-34](figures/image_2021-03-04-11-26-34.png)

![image_2021-03-04-11-30-34](figures/image_2021-03-04-11-30-34.png)

-   Here \( D( \varphi) = 0 \) and \( e(D) = 1 + {1\over 4}(0) - {1\over 4} (0) = 0 \).
-   \( n_x(D (\varphi ) ) = n_{x_1}( D ) + n_{x_2}(D)F = {1\over 4} + {1\over 4} = {1\over 2} \).
-   \( n_y(D ( \varphi ) ) = n_{y_1}(D) + n_{y_2}(D) + {1\over 4} + {1\over 4} = {1\over 2} \).
-   So \( \mu( \varphi) = 1 \).

2.  A second type:

![image_2021-03-04-11-32-08](figures/image_2021-03-04-11-32-08.png)

-   Here we have an annulus and \( D( \varphi) = D \) implies that \( e(D (\varphi)) = e(D) = \chi(D) + \cdots = 0 + {1\over 4}(0) - {1\over 4}( 4) = -1 \).
-   \( n_{x} (D( \varphi ) ) = n_{x_1}( D) + n_{x_2}(D) = {1\over 4} + {1\over 4} = {1\over 2} \)
-   \( \mu( \varphi) = -1 + {1\over 2} + {1\over 2} = 0 \).

3.  A third type:

![image_2021-03-04-11-36-09](figures/image_2021-03-04-11-36-09.png)

-   Here \( x_2 = y_2 \) and are disjoint from \( D_1, D_2, D_3 \):
-   \( D( \varphi) = D_1 + D_2 + D_3 \).
-   \( e(D ( \varphi ) ) = \sum e(D_i) = \qty{1 - {1\over 4}(4) } + \qty{1 - {1\over 4}(2) } + \qty{1 - {1\over 4}(2)} = 0 + {1\over 2} + {1\over 2} = 1 \).
    -   We could have alternatively noted that \( D( \varphi) \) is a disc with \( \chi =1 \) and used the formula to get \( 1 +{1\over 4}(1) - {1\over 4}(1) \).
-   \( n_x(D( \varphi ) ) = n_{x_1}(D( \varphi ) ) + n_{x_2}(D( \varphi ) ) = {1\over 4} + 0 = {1\over 4} \).
-   \( n_y(D (\varphi)) = n_{y_1}(D( \varphi ) ) + n_{y_2}(D( \varphi ) ) = {3\over 4} + 0 = {3\over 4} \).
-   Thus \( \mu( \varphi) = 2 \).

For \( \varphi\in \pi_2(x, y) \), if \( \mathcal{M}( \varphi) \neq \emptyset \) then \( D( \varphi) \geq 0 \), i.e. \( D( \varphi ) = \sum n_i D_i \) where \( n_i \geq 0 \). This happens if and only if \( n_w( \varphi) \geq 0 \) for all \( w \in \Sigma \setminus\alpha\cup\beta \).

Consider \( S^1 \times S^2 \) with the following Heegard diagram:

We have \( \widehat{\operatorname{HF}} (\Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z) = {\mathbb{Z}}/2 \left\langle{ x,y }\right\rangle \). Then for \( \varphi\in \pi_2(x, y) \) with \( \mu( \varphi) = 1 \) and \( n_z( \varphi) = 0 \), we can write \( D( \varphi) = a D_1 + b D_2 \). Now checking the diagonals:

![image_2021-03-04-12-20-40](figures/image_2021-03-04-12-20-40.png)

Since the sum of multiplicities NW \( \to \) SE should be 1 more than the sum NE \( \to \) SW, we have \( a+b=1 \) and by the positivity principle, \( D( \varphi) \geq 0 \) implies \( a, b \geq 0 \). We then obtain
\[
\begin{cases}
a = 0, b = 1 &  \implies D( \varphi) = D_2 \ni \phi_2

a = 1, b = 0 & \implies D( \varphi) = D_1 \ni \phi_1

For any \( p \) on the \( \alpha \) circle from \( y \) to \( x \), there exists a unique holomorphic map with \( \mu(1) = p \) by the Riemann mapping theorem. After taking the quotient \( \widehat{\mathcal{M}} ( \varphi_1) = \mathcal{M}(\varphi_1) / {\mathbb{R}} \), we obtain \( \# \widehat{\mathcal{M}} ( \varphi_1 ) = 1 = \# \mathcal{M}( \varphi_2 ) \). Then note that
\[
{{\partial}}x = \qty{ \# \widehat{\mathcal{M}} ( \varphi_1) + \# \widehat{ \mathcal{M} } ( \varphi_2) } y = 0
,\]
since we are taking coefficients mod 2. Then \( \varphi\in \mu(x, y) \) implies that \( a+b=-1 \), so there is no non-negative disk and \( {{\partial}}y = 0 \).

Recall that we were working with a diagram for \( S^1 \times S^2 \):

Here we have \( {{\partial}}x = 2y = 0 \) since we're working mod 2, and \( {{\partial}}y = 0 \), so we have

\widehat{\operatorname{HF}}(H_1) = {\ker {{\partial}}\over \operatorname{im}{{\partial}}} = { \left\langle{ x, y }\right\rangle\over 1} = ({\mathbb{Z}}/2)^{\oplus 2}

A 2-chain \( P = \sum_{i=1}^m a_i D_i \) is called a **periodic domain** if and only if

1.  The local multiplicity of \( P \) at \( z \) is zero, i.e. \( n_z(P) = 0 \), and
2.  \( {{\partial}}P \) is a linear combination of \( \alpha, \beta \).

We should have \( n_1 + n_2 = 0 \), so any \( P = n(D_1 - D_2) \) will be a periodic domain. Checking the boundary yields \( {{\partial}}P = n \alpha \pm n \beta \). In fact there is single "generator" for the periodic domains here:

\( H_1 \) from above is weakly admissible, but \( H_2 \) is not.

::: {.remark}
For any Whitney disc \( \varphi\in \pi_2(x, x) \) with \( n_z( \varphi) = 0 \), \( D( \varphi) \) is a periodic domain. For any periodic domain \( P \), we can associate a homology class \( H(P) \in H_2(M) \). Writing
\[
{{\partial}}P = \sum_{i=1}^g a_i \alpha_i + \sum_{i=1}^g b_i \beta_i
\xrightarrow{H} 
H(P) \coloneqq[ P + \sum_{i=1}^g a_i A_i + \sum_{i=1}^g b_i B_i]
.\]
using that each \( \alpha_i \) is the boundary of some disc \( A_i \) in one handlebody, and \( \beta_i = {{\partial}}B_i \) similarly. Noting that \( P \) is a boundary, this amounts to adding a number of discs to get a closed nontrivial cycle.

# Thursday, March 11

::: {.remark}
Recall the example from last time: we are trying to show that changing a diagram by isotopy doesn't change the homology.

![image_2021-03-11-11-16-15](figures/image_2021-03-11-11-16-15.png)

Here we have \( g=1 \) and so \( \operatorname{Sym}^1(T^2) = T^2 \), and \( \alpha \cap\beta = \left\{{ a,b,c,d,e }\right\} \). So \( \widehat{\operatorname{HF}}( \Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z) = {\mathbb{Z}}/2 \left\langle{ a,b,c,d,e }\right\rangle \).

First mark the component that contains the base point \( z \) and give it a coefficient of zero:

![image_2021-03-11-11-18-34](figures/image_2021-03-11-11-18-34.png)

We can make this part bigger, and find that there are only two bigons involving \( a \).

![image_2021-03-11-11-23-41](figures/image_2021-03-11-11-23-41.png)

This is because starting at a point and following the orientation should yield red first and then blue, matching up with the orientation on the disc.

![image_2021-03-11-11-35-44](figures/image_2021-03-11-11-35-44.png)

So \( {{\partial}}a = {\color{yellow} b} + {\color{purple} d} \), since we require 90 degree corners. Similarly,

-   \( {{\partial}}e = b + d \)
-   \( {{\partial}}b = c \)
-   \( {{\partial}}d = c \)
-   \( {{\partial}}c = 0 \)

We can simplify this information with a graph with arrows pointing toward boundaries:

![image_2021-03-11-11-29-41](figures/image_2021-03-11-11-29-41.png)

Then any linear combination with the same image will have zero boundary, so we have
\[
\ker {{\partial}}&= \left\langle{ a + e, b + d, c }\right\rangle \\
\operatorname{im}{{\partial}}&= \left\langle{ b+d, c }\right\rangle 
,\]
and thus \( \widehat{\operatorname{HF}}(\Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z) = {\mathbb{Z}}/2 \).

Drawing this on a surface yields the following:

![image_2021-03-11-12-01-09](figures/image_2021-03-11-12-01-09.png)

One useful trick here is labeling the points along one curve with letters and the other with numbers. Another is making a table like the following:

![image_2021-03-11-12-05-41](figures/image_2021-03-11-12-05-41.png)

From this it's easy to read off the 4 possible generators \( \left\{{ ae, ce, bf, bd }\right\} \). The regions the contain \( z \) can be seen in the latter picture:

![image_2021-03-11-12-07-48](figures/image_2021-03-11-12-07-48.png)

Translating this to the original picture yields these regions:

![image_2021-03-11-12-09-26](figures/image_2021-03-11-12-09-26.png)

Note that the half-bigons in the diagram actually pair to a bigon on the surface, so consider this simplified drawing of the surface:

![image_2021-03-11-12-11-38](figures/image_2021-03-11-12-11-38.png)

-   For the bigon from \( a \to c \), we can get \( ae\to ce \) using the embedding
    \[
    {\mathbb{D}}\xrightarrow{u} \Sigma\hookrightarrow\operatorname{Sym}^2( \Sigma)
    .\]

-   For the bigon \( d\to f \), we get \( bd\to bf \).

Setting \( D_1 = D( \varphi) \) for \( \varphi\in \pi_2( ae, bf ) \), we have \( \mu( \varphi) = 1 \) since we showed that rectangular regions have Maslov index 1. Are there any holomorphic representatives? The claim is that \( \# \widehat{\mathcal{M}}( \varphi) \). Checking boundaries yields the following:

![image_2021-03-11-12-19-43](figures/image_2021-03-11-12-19-43.png)

Then
\[
\ker {{\partial}}&= \left\langle{ ce, bf }\right\rangle \\ 
\operatorname{im}{{\partial}}&= \left\langle{ ce + bf }\right\rangle \\ 
&\implies \widehat{HF}(\Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z) \cong {\mathbb{Z}}
.\]
This is good, since some valid moves will make this into a standard diagram for \( S^3 \) (?).
:::

::: {.remark}
Recall that given a rectangle, there is a 2-to-1 branched cover:

![image_2021-03-11-12-25-02](figures/image_2021-03-11-12-25-02.png)

Such branched coverings bijectively correspond to biholomorphic involutions
\[
a &\rightleftharpoons e \\
b &\rightleftharpoons f
.\]

This is because there is a unique involution exchanging them by the Schwarz lemma, since any pole of the involution must lie along the line connecting points it exchanges, and exchanging each pair of corners in the rectangle forces to pole to be precisely the point in the center of the rectangle. So these correspond got biholomorphic involutions of \( {\mathbb{D}} \) using complex analysis.

# Maslov Grading and \( \mathrm{Spin}^{\mathbb{C} } \) Structures (Tuesday, March 16) {#maslov-grading-and-mathrmspinmathbbc-structures-tuesday-march-16}

::: {.remark}
Let \( M\in {\mathsf{Mfd}}^3({\mathbb{R}}) \) be a closed oriented 3-manifold and \( \mathcal{H} = (\Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z) \) a Heegaard diagram for \( M \). Letting \( b_i \) be the Betti numbers, note that \( b_1 = 0 \iff M \in \operatorname{QHS}^3 \) is a rational homology 3-sphere, i.e. \( H_i(M; {\mathbb{Q}}) \cong H_i(S^3; {\mathbb{Q}}) \) for all \( i \). This also implies that \( H_2(M; {\mathbb{Z}}) = 0 \). Under this condition, we can define a **relative \( {\mathbb{Z}}{\hbox{-}} \)grading** (i.e. we have a difference of grading between any two elements) on \( \widehat{CF} \) in the following way: for \( x, y \) two generators, we set
\[
{\mathsf{gr}\,}(x) - {\mathsf{gr}\,}(y) \coloneqq\mu( \varphi) -2n_z( \varphi) && \text{for some } \varphi\in \pi_2(x,y)
.\]

Recall that \( \mu({-}) \) denotes the Maslov index, \( n_z( {-}) \) is the local multiplicity of a Whitney disc at \( z \), and \( x, y \) denote tuples of points.
:::

::: {.remark}
This involves a choice of disc, so why is it well-defined? We'll also see why we need \( M\in \operatorname{QHS}^3 \).
:::

::: {.proof title="of well-definedness"}
Let \( \varphi, \varphi' \in \pi_2(x, y) \). We have
\[
\varphi \ast (-\varphi') \in \pi_2(x, x) = {\mathbb{Z}}\oplus H_2(M) = {\mathbb{Z}}\oplus 0
,\]
so this is some multiple \( kS \) where \( S \) is the positive generator of \( \pi_2\operatorname{Sym}^g \Sigma \). So
\[
\mu( \varphi \ast (- \varphi') ) = \mu( \varphi) - \mu( \varphi') = k \mu(S) = 2k
.\]
Similarly,
\[
n_z( \varphi \ast (- \varphi')) = n_z( \varphi) - n_z( \varphi') = k n_z(S) = k
,\]
where we've used \( \mu(S) = 2, n_z(S) = 1 \). Then
\[
\mu( \varphi) - \mu ( \varphi') 
&= 2( n_z( \varphi) - n_z( \varphi') ) \\
\implies
\mu( \varphi) - 2n_z( \varphi) 
&= \mu( \varphi') - 2 n_z( \varphi')
.\]
:::

::: {.remark}
Note that the relative grading is only defined if \( \pi_2(x, y) \neq \emptyset \iff \varepsilon(x, y) = 0 \in H_1(M; {\mathbb{Z}}) \). This generated an equivalence relation of elements in \( {\mathbb{T}}_{ \alpha} \cap{\mathbb{T}}_{ \beta} \) by \( x\sim y \iff \varepsilon(x, y) = 0 \), so we have a decomposition
\[
\widehat{CF}( \mathcal{H} ) = \bigoplus _{?} \widehat{CF}( \mathcal{H}, ?)  
.\]
which is preserved by \( {{\partial}} \), so \( \widehat{HF}(\mathcal{H}) \) will split similarly as
\[
\widehat{HF}( \mathcal{H} ) = \bigoplus _{?} \widehat{CF}( \mathcal{H}, ?)  
.\]

For each \( x = \left\{{ { {x}_1, {x}_2, \cdots, {x}_{g}} }\right\} \cap{\mathbb{T}}_{ \alpha} \cap{\mathbb{T}}_{\beta} \), we have \( x_i \in \alpha_i \cap\beta_{\sigma(i)} \) for some permutation \( \sigma\in S_g \) Then \( \alpha\mapsto p_i \) and \( \beta_{\sigma(i)} \mapsto q_{\sigma(i)} \):

![image_2021-03-16-11-49-42](figures/image_2021-03-16-11-49-42.png)

Trajectories of \( -\nabla f \) that pass through \( { {x}_1, {x}_2, \cdots, {x}_{g}} \) are \( g \) pairwise disjoint arcs connecting \( { {q}_1, {q}_2, \cdots, {q}_{g}} \) to \( { {p}_1, {p}_2, \cdots, {p}_{g}} \), so there is a one-to-one correspondence between these intersection points.

Now taking tubular neighborhoods of the \( g+1 \) disjoint arcs yields \( g+1 \) pairwise disjoint 3-balls in \( M \), so write this as \( B\coloneqq B_1 \coprod \cdots \coprod B_{g+1} \).

![image_2021-03-16-11-53-04](figures/image_2021-03-16-11-53-04.png)

Note that

-   \( -\nabla f \) does not vanish in \( M \setminus B \).

-   \( - \nabla f \) can be extended to a nowhere vanishing vector field on \( M \)

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Show this!

*Hint: the trajectories of \( -\nabla f \) in each ball connect critical points of different parities, and so each \( { \left.{{-\nabla f }} \right|_{{{{\partial}}B_i }} } \) has index zero.*
:::

Define \( S_z(x) \in \mathrm{Spin}^{\mathbb{C} }(M) \) to be the equivalence class represented by this vector field. This is well-defined since outside of the finitely many balls, this vector field is just equal to \( -\nabla f \).

Note that if \( v_1 \sim v_2 \), we have \( \delta^{ \tau}(v_1) = \delta^{ \tau}(v_2) \) since they are homotopic on the complement of a ball:

Conclude that
\[
(f_{v_1} \circ i)^* ( \alpha) = (f_{v_2} \circ i)^* (\alpha)

## \( \mathrm{Spin}^{\mathbb{C} } \) Structures and Invariance {#mathrmspinmathbbc-structures-and-invariance}

::: {.remark}
Recall that given a Heegard diagram \( ( \Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z ) \) gives an equivalence relation
\[
x \sim y \iff \varepsilon(x, y) = 0 \in H_1(M) \overset{\mathrm{PD}}{=} H^2(M)
.\]
This yields a decomposition of \( \widehat{\operatorname{HF}} \) into a direct sum over equivalence classes of subcomplexes defined by \( \mathrm{Spin}^{\mathbb{C} } \) structures. Note that the differential will preserve each direct summand. We defined \( \mathrm{Spin}^{\mathbb{C} }(M) \) as the set of nowhere vanishing vector fields on \( M \) modulo being homotopic outside finitely many 3-balls in \( M \). We had a map
\[
{\mathbb{T}}_{ \alpha} \cap{\mathbb{T}}_{\beta} \xrightarrow{s_z} \mathrm{Spin}^{\mathbb{C} }(M)
,\]
recalling that the left-hand side are the generators of \( \widehat{\operatorname{HF}} \). We took a self-indexing Morse function on \( M \), took the inverse image of \( 3/2 \) to get the Heegard surface, and each intersection point \( x_i \) gave a flow line from an index 2 critical point to an index 1 critical point passing through \( x_i \):

![Trajectories of negative gradient flow](figures/image_2021-03-18-11-19-00.png)

We proceeded by cancelling adjacent flow lines (at the level of vector fields), and then modifying \( \gamma_z \) (the flow line passing through the basepoint \( z \) connecting the index 0 to the index 3) to get a nowhere vanishing vector field. We then took a trivialization \( \tau: TM \to M \times{\mathbb{R}}^3 \) defined a map
\[
\mathrm{Spin}^{\mathbb{C} }(M) &\xrightarrow{\gamma^ \tau} H^2(M) \\
s = [v] &\mapsto f_v^*( \alpha)
.\]
where \( \alpha \) is the volume form of \( S^2 \) and
\[
f_v: M &\to S^2 \\
x &\mapsto \widehat{v_x} \coloneqq{ v_x \over {\left\lVert {v_x} \right\rVert} }
.\]
Note that \( \delta^\tau \) a priori depends on \( \tau \), but
\[
\delta(s_1, s_2) = \delta^{ \tau}(s_1) - \delta^{ \tau}(s_2) \in H^2(M)
,\]
and the difference is independent of \( \tau \).
:::

::: {.lemma title="?"}
For \( x, y\in {\mathbb{T}}_{ \alpha} \cap{\mathbb{T}}_{ \beta} \), defining \( s_1 - s_2 = \delta(s_1, s_2) \in H^2(M) \), we have
\[
s_z(y) - s_z(x) = \mathrm{PD}[\varepsilon(x, y) ]
.\]

As corollaries,

1.  If \( x\sim y \) then \( s_z(y) = s_z(x) \), and
2.  If \( x\not\sim y \) then the above equation holds.
:::

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Prove this!

*Hint, take the Poincaré dual of the link below to get the formula:*
\[
s_z(y) - s_z(x) = \mathrm{PD}[ \gamma_y \cup(- \gamma_x)]
.\]
*This implies that the two vector fields are equal everywhere outside of a tubular neighborhood of the link. Then show that \( [ \gamma_x \cup(-\gamma_x) = [ \varepsilon(x, y) ] \).*
:::

::: {.remark}
We thus have
\[
\widehat{\operatorname{HF}}( \Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z)
= \bigoplus _{{\mathfrak{s}}\in \mathrm{Spin}^{\mathbb{C} }(M)} 
\widehat{\operatorname{HF}}( \Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z, {\mathfrak{s}})
.\]
:::

::: {.remark}
We have several properties of \( \mathrm{Spin}^{\mathbb{C} } \) structures. There is a map
\[
J: \mathrm{Spin}^{\mathbb{C} }(M) &\to \mathrm{Spin}^{\mathbb{C} }(M) \\
s = [v] &\mapsto {\overline{{s}}} \coloneqq[-v]
.\]
There is also a first Chern class
\[
c_1: \mathrm{Spin}^{\mathbb{C} }(M) &\to H^2(M) \\
s &\mapsto s - {\overline{{s}}}
,\]
i.e. \( c_1(s) = \delta(s, {\overline{{s}}}) \).
:::

::: {.theorem title="Topological Invariance"}
The association
\[
( \Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z), J \leadsto 
\widehat{\operatorname{HF}}
( \Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z)
\]
does not depend on the choice of Heegard diagram or the almost complex structure \( J \), so this yields a well-defined invariant of \( M \) which we'll denote \( \widehat{\operatorname{HF}}(M) \) for \( M\in {\mathsf{Mfd}}^3({\mathbb{R}}) \).
:::

::: {.remark}
There are few things to discuss:

1.  The almost complex structure \( J \):

2.  Isotopies

3.  Handle slides

4.  Stabilization

Remarks on these:

1.  This involves a standard argument from Lagrangian Floer homology.
2.  There are two cases:
    -   If the isotopy doesn't create a new intersection, we have a 1-to-1 correspondence between generators for any two choices, and changing \( J \) to \( J' \) will give a correspondence between the differentials. This just involves picking a diffeomorphism that maps \( \alpha \) circles to \( \alpha' \) circles, and so on. So this reduces to showing 1.
    -   If is *does* create new intersection points, there are again standard arguments in Lagrangian Floer homology for this.
3.  This involves the following situation, which induces a map

![image_2021-03-18-11-51-38](figures/image_2021-03-18-11-51-38.png)

For an appropriate choice of \( J \) on \( \Sigma \mathop{ \Large\scalebox{0.8}{\raisebox{0.4ex}{\#}}}T^2 \), the map \( f \) above will induce a chain homotopy equivalence
\[
\tilde f: 
\widehat{\operatorname{HF}}
(\Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z)
\xrightarrow{\sim} 
\widehat{\operatorname{HF}}
(\Sigma \mathop{ \Large\scalebox{0.8}{\raisebox{0.4ex}{\#}}}T^2, \alpha', \beta', z)
.\]

4.  What's the picture?

![image_2021-03-18-11-56-59](figures/image_2021-03-18-11-56-59.png)

This will yield a map
\[
  (\Sigma, \alpha, {\color{blue} \beta}, z)
  \leadsto
  (\Sigma, \alpha, {\color{green} \gamma}, z)
  .\]
For \( i = 1, \cdots, g-1 \), we'll have \( \gamma_i \) isotopic to \( \beta_i \), and for \( i=g \), \( \gamma_g \) is obtained by sliding \( \beta_g \) over \( \beta_{g-1} \). We'll combine these into the same diagram with different colors to compare them, yielding a **Heegard triple**:
\[
  (\Sigma, {\color{red} \alpha}, {\color{blue} \beta}, { \color{green} \gamma}, z)
  .\]
We can think of this as three separate diagrams:
\[
  (\Sigma, {\color{red} \alpha}, {\color{blue} \beta}, z)
  &\leadsto M\\
  (\Sigma, {\color{blue} \beta}, { \color{green} \gamma}, z)
  &\leadsto ? \\
  (\Sigma, {\color{red} \alpha}, { \color{green} \gamma}, z)
  &\leadsto M
  .\]
What does the middle one represent?

![Heegard diagram](figures/image_2021-03-18-12-02-39.png)

Here this is a diagram for \( (S^1 \times S^2)^{\mathop{ \Large\scalebox{0.8}{\raisebox{0.4ex}{\#}}}2} \).

Note that we draw \( \gamma_i \) such that it intersects \( \beta_i \) in two transverse intersection points to make sure the diagram is admissible.
:::

::: {.remark}
Give a Heegard triple \( ( \Sigma, \alpha, \beta, \gamma, z \), pick three intersection points
\[
x &\in {\mathbb{T}}_{ \alpha} \cap{\mathbb{T}}_{ \beta} \\
y &\in {\mathbb{T}}_{ \beta} \cap{\mathbb{T}}_{ \gamma} \\
w &\in {\mathbb{T}}_{ \gamma} \cap{\mathbb{T}}_{ \alpha} 
.\]
We can use **Whitney triangles** to connect \( x,y,w \):

![image_2021-03-18-12-23-07](figures/image_2021-03-18-12-23-07.png)

We then define \( \pi_2(x,y,z) \) to be the homotopy class of Whitney triangles connecting \( x,y,w \). We can similarly define \( {\mathcal{M}}( \psi ) \) to be the moduli space of \( J{\hbox{-}} \)holomorphic representatives of \( \psi\in \pi_2(x,y,w) \), along with a chain map
\[
f_{\alpha \beta \gamma}: 
\widehat{\operatorname{HF}}(\Sigma, \alpha, \beta, z)
\otimes
\widehat{\operatorname{HF}}(\Sigma, \beta, \gamma z)
&\to
\widehat{\operatorname{HF}}(\Sigma, \alpha, \gamma, z) \\
x\otimes y 
&\mapsto 
\sum_{ w \in {\mathbb{T}}_{ \alpha} \cap{\mathbb{T}}_{ \beta}} 
\sum_{\substack{ \psi\in \pi_2(x,y,w) \\ \mu( \psi) = 0 \\ n_z( \psi) = 0 }}
\# {\mathcal{M}}( \psi) \cdot w
.\]
:::

::: {.theorem title="?"}
\( f_{ \alpha \beta \gamma} \) is a chain map.

Next time: we'll show how to get a chain homotopy equivalence from the first tensor term above to the codomain. We'll also see surgery exact triangles.

A Heegaard diagram is called **nice** if every connected component of \( \Sigma\setminus\alpha\cup\beta \) that does not contain \( z \) is either a bigon or a rectangle.
:::

::: {.remark}
For nice Heegaard diagrams, the Maslov index 1 holomorphic discs with \( n_z( \varphi) = 0 \) are embedded bigons and rectangles.
:::

::: {.lemma title="?"}
Any 3-manifold has a nice Heegaard diagram, so computing \( \widehat{\operatorname{HF}} \) is combinatorial.
:::

::: {.remark}
Some properties:

1.  \( \mathrm{Spin}^{\mathbb{C} } \) structures: we have a decomposition
    \[
      \operatorname{HF}^-(M) = \bigoplus _{s\in \mathrm{Spin}^{\mathbb{C} }(M) } \operatorname{HF}^-(M, s)
      \]
    which induces
    \[
      \operatorname{HF}^\star(M) = \bigoplus_{s\in \mathrm{Spin}^{\mathbb{C} }(M)} \operatorname{HF}^\star(M, s)
      \]
    where \( \star = +, -, \infty \).

2.  Maslov grading: For a \( \operatorname{QHS}^3 \), \( \operatorname{HF}^-(M) \) is relatively \( {\mathbb{Z}}{\hbox{-}} \)graded. The degree of \( u \) is -2, and this grading can be lifted to an absolute \( {\mathbb{Q}}{\hbox{-}} \)grading.

3.  There is a SES
    \[
    0 \to \operatorname{HF}^-(M, s) \xrightarrow{\cdot u} \operatorname{HF}^-(M, s) \to \widehat{\operatorname{HF}}(M, s) \to 0
    .\]

This yields an exact triangle

4.  There is a short exact sequence

\[
0 \to \operatorname{HF}^-(M) \to \operatorname{HF}^{\infty }(M) \to \operatorname{HF}^+(M) \to 0
.\]

yielding an exact triangle

5.  \( {\mathbb{Z}}/2[u] \) is a PID, so by the structure theorem, any module over it will decompose and we have
    \[
    \operatorname{HF}^-(M, s) = \bigoplus_{i} {\mathbb{Z}}/2[u] \oplus \bigoplus_j {{\mathbb{Z}}/2[u] \over \left\langle{u^{n_j}}\right\rangle }
    .\]

Supposing that \( M \in \operatorname{QHS}^3 \), then by Osvath-Szabo, for any \( s\in \mathrm{Spin}^{\mathbb{C} }(M) \) there is exactly one free summand. Let \( d \) be the Maslov grading of the free generator, and \( c_j \) be the grading of the torsion part. We write the \( u{\hbox{-}} \)torsion part as \( \operatorname{HF}_{ \text{red} }(M, s) \).
:::

::: {.definition title="$d\\dash$invariant"}
The Maslov grading of the free summand \( d = d(M, s) \) is referred to as the **\( d{\hbox{-}} \)invariant** or correction term, and

.\]
:::

The **rational homology cobordism group** is denoted
\[
\qty{\Theta_{\mathbb{Q}}^3 \coloneqq\left\{{ M \in \operatorname{QHS}^3 }\right\} /\sim, \mathop{ \Large\scalebox{0.8}{\raisebox{0.4ex}{\#}}}}
\]
where \( M_1\sim M_2 \) if and only if they are *rationally homology cobordant*, i.e. 

1.  There exists an \( W \in {\mathsf{Mfd}}^4 \) (connected, oriented) such that \( {{\partial}}W = -M_1 {\coprod}M_2 \), i.e. \( W \) is a cobordism from \( M_1 \) to \( M_2 \).

2.  \( H_i(W; {\mathbb{Q}}) = 0 \) for \( i=1, 2 \), so \( W \) is a rational homology cylinder.

Recall that we were discussing \( \operatorname{HF}^-(M, s) \) for \( M\in {\mathsf{Mfd}}^3({\mathbb{R}}) \) and \( s \) a \( \mathrm{Spin}^{\mathbb{C} } \) structure, and if \( M\in \operatorname{QHS} \) this decomposes as \( {\mathbb{Z}}/2[u] \oplus \qty{\bigoplus_i {{\mathbb{Z}}/2[u] \over \left\langle{u^{}n_i}\right\rangle }} \coloneqq{\mathbb{Z}}/2[u] \oplus \operatorname{HF}_{ \text{red} }(M, s) \). The Maslov grading of \( 1 \) in the first summand is the **\( d{\hbox{-}} \)invariant**, \( d(M, s) \). If one defines \( d(M) \coloneqq\sum_{s\in \mathrm{Spin}^{\mathbb{C} }(M)} d(M, s) \), then \( d: \Theta^3_{\mathbb{Q}}\to {\mathbb{Q}} \) is a group homomorphism. We want to talk about \( X\in {\mathsf{Mfd}}^3 \) which have the "simplest" Floer theory, in the sense that the torsion summand above vanishes.
:::

::: {.definition title="?"}
A manifold \( M\in\operatorname{QHS}^3 \) is an **\( L{\hbox{-}} \)space** if \( \operatorname{HF}_{ \text{red} }(M, s) = 0 \), which happens if and only if \( \operatorname{HF}^-(M, s) = {\mathbb{Z}}/2[u] \).

Since multiplication by \( u \) is injective, we obtain

\( M \) is an \( L{\hbox{-}} \)space if and only if \( \widehat{\operatorname{HF}}(M, s) \cong {\mathbb{Z}}/2 \) for all \( s\in \mathrm{Spin}^{\mathbb{C} }(M) \). This happens if and only if \( {\operatorname{rank}}_{{\mathbb{Z}}[u]} \widehat{\operatorname{HF}}(M, s) = 1 \), if and only if \( \# \mathrm{Spin}^{\mathbb{C} }(M) = \# H^2(M) \overset{\mathrm{PD}}{=} \# H^1(M) \), which is finite for \( \operatorname{QHS} \).

Any \( M\in \operatorname{QHS}^3 \) is an \( L{\hbox{-}} \)space if and only if \( {\operatorname{rank}}_{{\mathbb{Z}}[u]} \widehat{\operatorname{HF}}(M) = \# H^1(M) \).
:::

::: {.remark}
Note that we've proved the forward implication but not the reverse. This is sometimes used as a definition in talks!

Sketch of the proof (\( \impliedby \)): A computation will show that \( \chi \widehat{\operatorname{HF}}(M, s) = \pm 1 \) for all \( s \), since the grading can be shifted. This is proved in [@OS-2 p.33], and is the main ingredient in this proof. This implies that \( {\operatorname{rank}}\widehat{\operatorname{HF}}(M, s) \geq 1 \), and so adding all summands yields \( {\operatorname{rank}}\widehat{\operatorname{HF}}(M) \geq \# H_1(M) \). This implies that \( \widehat{\operatorname{HF}}(M, s) \cong {\mathbb{Z}}/2 \) for all \( s \), making \( M \) an \( L{\hbox{-}} \)space.
:::

::: {.remark}
Here note that \( C_* \) is \( {\mathbb{Z}}/2{\hbox{-}} \)graded, as is \( (\widehat{\operatorname{HF}}(M), {{\partial}}) \), so we define \( \chi(C_*) = {\operatorname{rank}}C_0 - {\operatorname{rank}}C_1 \). Since we have a relative \( {\mathbb{Z}}{\hbox{-}} \)grading given by \( \mu \), we get a relative \( {\mathbb{Z}}/2{\hbox{-}} \)grading given by \( {\mathsf{gr}\,}_{{\mathbb{Z}}/2}(x, y) = {\mathsf{gr}\,}_{\mathbb{Z}}(x, y) \), which gives us \( \chi \widehat{\operatorname{HF}}(M) \) up to sign.

## Surgery

::: {.definition title="Dehn Surgery"}
Let \( K \subseteq M \in {\mathsf{Mfd}}^3 \) be a knot, i.e. the image of an embedding \( S^1 \hookrightarrow M \). Remove a tubular neighborhood of \( K \), and set \( X = M\setminus\nu(K) \). Fill in the torus boundary with a solid torus \( S^1 \times{\mathbb{D}}^2 \) using a diffeomorphism
\[
\phi: {{\partial}}(S^1 \times{\mathbb{D}}^2) \xrightarrow{\text{diffeo}} {{\partial}}X
.\]

Any surgery will be determined by the image of the red circle \( \gamma \coloneqq{\operatorname{pt}}\times{{\partial}}{\mathbb{D}}^2 \) in the following:

![image_2021-03-30-12-01-24](figures/image_2021-03-30-12-01-24.png)

So \( \phi \) is determined by \( \phi( \gamma) \), and in fact only depends on its class in homology since \( \pi_1T^2 = H_1T^2 \). If \( \phi ( \gamma) = \lambda \), we denote the resulting manifold as \( M_{\lambda}(K) \), the **Dehn surgery on \( K \)**.
:::

::: {.definition title="Meridian and Longitude"}
A **meridian** \( \mu \) of \( K \) will be a simple closed curve on \( {{\partial}}X \) that bounds a disk in the tubular neighborhood \( \nu(K) \):

![image_2021-03-30-12-05-02](figures/image_2021-03-30-12-05-02.png)

Here we orient \( \mu \) on the boundary of this disk.

A **longitude** will be a nullhomotopic simple closed curve such that \( \#( \mu \cap\lambda) = -1 \). For example:

![image_2021-03-30-12-07-30](figures/image_2021-03-30-12-07-30.png)?
:::

::: {.observation}
```{=tex}
\envlist
```
-   \( \lambda \) is not unique, i.e. \( \lambda + n\mu \) will again be a longitude for all \( n\in {\mathbb{Z}} \).

-   \( \mu, \lambda \) is a basis for \( H_1({{\partial}}X) \), so any simple closed curve \( \gamma \) is a \( {\mathbb{Z}}{\hbox{-}} \)linear combination of them:
    \[
    [ \gamma] = a [ \mu] + b [ \lambda], && a,b\in {\mathbb{Z}}
    .\]
:::

::: {.definition title="?"}
A knot \( K \) along with a choice of longitude \( \lambda \) is called a **framed knot**.
:::

::: {.remark}
This allows us to specify Dehn surgeries by a rational number.
:::

::: {.definition title="?"}
Let \( K \) be a framed knot, then \( M_{p\over q}(K) = M_{\gamma}(K) \) where \( [\gamma] = p [\mu] + q[ \lambda] \). We'll use the notation \( \gamma = p\mu + q\lambda \).
:::

::: {.definition title="?"}
If \( K \) is nullhomologous, for example when \( M = S^3 \) since \( H^1S^3 = 0 \), there is a canonical choice for \( \lambda \) by assuming that

-   \( \lambda \) is nullhomologous in \( X = M \setminus\nu(K) \)
-   Equivalently, \( \operatorname{lk}(K, \lambda) = 0 \).

This longitude is called the **Seifert framing**.
:::

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Show this equivalence, and find the Seifert framing for the trefoil in \( S^3 \).

-   \( S^3_{0} \coloneqq S^3_{0\over 1} = S^1 \times S^2 \)
-   \( S^3_{+1}(T_{2, 3}) = P^3 \) (torus knot).

## Surgery Exact Triangle

::: {.definition title="Surgery on a Knot"}
Recall that for \( K \subseteq M^3 \) a knot, surgery on \( K \) involves the following: take a tubular neighborhood of \( K \), \( \operatorname{nd}(K) \), and set \( X \coloneqq M \setminus\operatorname{nd}(K) \), whose boundary is a solid torus \( S^1 \times{\mathbb{D}}^2 \):

![image_2021-04-06-11-18-17](figures/image_2021-04-06-11-18-17.png)

Take a basis for its homology:

-   \( \mu \) to be a meridian of \( K \), which bounds a disc in \( M^3 \).
-   \( \lambda \) to be a meridian of \( K \) with \( \#(\mu \cap\lambda) = -1 \). Note that there are many choices, we can wind many times:

![image_2021-04-06-11-19-05](figures/image_2021-04-06-11-19-05.png)

We can then write any simple closed curve \( \gamma \) as \( [\gamma] = p[\mu] + q[\lambda] \), where for shorthand we'll just write \( \gamma= p \mu + q \lambda \). We'll refer to the pair \( (K, \lambda) \) as a **framed knot** and the corresponding surgery as \( M_{p\over q}(K) \), which is surgery on \( K \) such that the following curve is \( p\mu + q\lambda \):

![image_2021-04-06-11-22-32](figures/image_2021-04-06-11-22-32.png)

We'll write \( M_{ \lambda}(L) = M_0(K) \) for the surgery that sends \( \lambda \) to this curve instead, since this corresponds to \( p=0, q=1 \).
:::

::: {.definition title="Triad of 3-Manifolds"}
Suppose \( \gamma_0, \gamma_1, \gamma_{\infty } \) are oriented simple closed curves on \( {{\partial}}X = M - \operatorname{nd}(K) \) such that
\[
-1 = \#( \gamma_0 \cap\gamma_1) = \#( \gamma_1 \cap\gamma_{\infty }) = \#( \gamma_{\infty } \cap\gamma_0)
,\]
and we have a cyclic ordering

```{=tex}

    \\
    {\gamma_\infty} && {\gamma_1}

Then writing \( M_{i } \coloneqq M_{ \gamma_{i }}(K) \), the triple \( (M_{\infty }, M_0, M_1) \) is a **tried of 3-manifold**.
:::

::: {.example title="?"}
Let \( \gamma_{\infty } = \mu, \gamma_0 = \lambda, \gamma_1 = a\mu - b\lambda \), and the punch line is that the third is determined by the other two. What are \( a \) and \( b \)? We have
\[
\#(\gamma_0, \cap\gamma_1) = \#( \lambda, a\mu + b \lambda) = -a \#(\mu \cap\lambda) = (-1) a \implies a = -1 
\\ \\
\#( \gamma_1 \cap\gamma_{\infty }) = \#( a \mu + b\lambda, \mu) = b \#(\lambda \cap\mu) = b(1) = b \implies b = -1
.\]
We thus obtain the following picture, which has the curves arrange in a clockwise fashion:

![image_2021-04-06-11-32-35](figures/image_2021-04-06-11-32-35.png)

Here we get the triad \( (M_{\infty }(K) = M, M_0(K), M_1(K) \).
:::

::: {.exercise title="?"}
Show that \( (M, M_{-1}(K), M_0(K)) \) is also a triad.
:::

::: {.example title="?"}
Let \( \lambda_{\infty } = p\mu + q\lambda \) and \( \lambda_0 = r\mu + s\lambda \), then
\[
-1 
&= \#( \gamma_{\infty } \cap\gamma_0) \\
&= \#( p\mu + q \lambda, r \mu + s \lambda) \\
&= ps \#( \mu \cap\lambda) + qr \# (\lambda \cap\mu) \\
&= -ps + qr \\
&\implies qr - ps = 1
.\]

Similarly,
\[
-1 = \#( \gamma_0 \cap\gamma_1) &= sa -rb = -1 
\#( \gamma_1 \cap\gamma_{\infty }) &= bp - aq = -1
.\]
:::

::: {.example title="?"}
Pick a framed knot \( K \) (or really just a fixed longitude), then pick \( \gamma_{\infty } = \mu, \gamma_0 = p\mu + \lambda \). Then \( \gamma_1 = (p+1) \mu + \lambda \), and we get the triad \( M_{\mu}(K) = M, M_{\gamma_0}(K) = M_p(K), M_{p+1}(K) \).

Then
\[
V_{\infty } = V_0 \oplus V_1 \iff {\operatorname{rank}}V_{\infty } = {\operatorname{rank}}(V_0) + {\operatorname{rank}}(V_1)

Equality holds if and only if \( {\operatorname{rank}}V_1 = {\operatorname{rank}}\operatorname{im}f_1 \), which implies \( f_1 \) is injective, and similarly \( {\operatorname{rank}}V_0 = {\operatorname{rank}}\operatorname{im}f_{\infty } \implies f_{\infty } \) is surjective.

# Surgery Exact Triangle and Knot Diagrams (Thursday, April 15)

-   \( \gamma_{\infty } \) is a meridian of \( K \),
-   \( \gamma_0 \) is a longitude of \( K \),

Our goal is to define \( f: \widehat{\operatorname{HF}}(M) \to \widehat{\operatorname{HF}}(M_0) \).

Note that \( M \) admits a Heegard diagram
\[
( \Sigma_g, \vec{ \alpha} = [\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_g], \vec{ \beta} = [\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_g] )
\]
such that \( (\Sigma_g, \vec \alpha, [\beta_1, \cdots, \beta_{g-1}] \) is a "diagram" for \( M - \operatorname{nd}(K) \). Recall the notion of handlebodies, where each handle bounds a disc:

![image_2021-04-15-11-20-29](figures/image_2021-04-15-11-20-29.png)

We can generalize this to a **compression body**:

![image_2021-04-15-11-22-13](figures/image_2021-04-15-11-22-13.png)

-   Start with \( \Sigma'_{g'} \times[0, 1] \).
-   Attach a solid handle \( K \) to \( \Sigma' \times\left\{{ 1 }\right\} \)

This yields a cobordism from \( \Sigma'_{g'} \times\left\{{ 0 }\right\} \) to \( \Sigma_{g' + k} \). So we can write \( {{\partial}}C = \Sigma' \times\left\{{ 0 }\right\} {\coprod}\Sigma \). Label the curves bounding the embedded discs as \( \gamma_i \):

![image_2021-04-15-11-24-22](figures/image_2021-04-15-11-24-22.png)

Then we can form a diagram \( (\Sigma_g, \left\{{ \gamma_1, \cdots, \gamma_k }\right\} \) where \( k\leq g \) will specify the compression body. If these are pairwise disjoint simple closed curves that are linearly independent in \( H_1( \Sigma ) \), this will be a compression body from a surface with genus \( g-k \) to \( \Sigma_g \).

![image_2021-04-15-11-31-50](figures/image_2021-04-15-11-31-50.png)

In this case, \( (\Sigma, \vec \alpha, \left\{{ \beta_1, \cdots, \beta_{g-1} }\right\} \) will be a diagram for \( M\setminus\operatorname{nd}(K) \).

![image_2021-04-15-11-39-41](figures/image_2021-04-15-11-39-41.png)

We can push the top down:

![image_2021-04-15-11-40-24](figures/image_2021-04-15-11-40-24.png)

And wrap part of it around:

![image_2021-04-15-11-43-42](figures/image_2021-04-15-11-43-42.png)

We can keep moving this to undo the crossing:

![image_2021-04-15-11-45-58](figures/image_2021-04-15-11-45-58.png)

So the blue curve gets complicated, but the neighborhood of \( T \) is a genus 2 surface, since the outer two circles bound discs. So in summary, we have the following process:

![image_2021-04-15-11-50-12](figures/image_2021-04-15-11-50-12.png)

We can represent this with a planar picture:

![image_2021-04-15-11-56-01](figures/image_2021-04-15-11-56-01.png)

Following the longitude, we obtain:

![image_2021-04-15-12-15-41](figures/image_2021-04-15-12-15-41.png)

Here \( \lambda \) has been wrapped twice, and to do \( n{\hbox{-}} \)surgery, we wrap \( n \) times.

[^2]: This is the strongest variant.

[^3]: What does "detect" mean? This is slightly technical.

[^4]: Note that wedging to a nontrivial top form is equivalent to being nowhere integrable here.

[^5]: These are referred to as **Seifert surfaces**.

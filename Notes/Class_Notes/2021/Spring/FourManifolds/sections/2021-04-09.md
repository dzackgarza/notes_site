Recall the adjunction formula: for $D \subset X \in \Mfd_\CC$ a codimension 1 complex submanifold, we have
\[
K_D = (K_x + \OO_x(0)) \ro{}{D}
.\]
We'll apply this to curves $C$ in a surface $S$.
Recall the genus formula, which was given by $2g(C) - 2= (C+ K_S)\cdot C$.
For example, a degree 4 equation in $\PP^2$ carves out a genus $g(C) = 3$ complex curve.

Recall that line bundles on $\CP^n$ were in bijection with $\ZZ$, where send $d$ to a bundle $\OO(d) \da \OO_{\CP^N}(d)$.
We produced the tautological line bundle $\OO(-1)$ whose fiber over $\vector x \subseteq \CP^n$ is the line in $\CC^n$ spanned by its coordinates. 
We have $\OO(-1)\dual \da \OO(1)$, and $\OO(n)\da \OO(1)^{\otimes n}$.
Alternatively, it was characterized in terms of homogeneous functions, where the fiber $\OO(n)_{\vector x}$ are the linear functions $L$ on lines $\ts{\lambda \vector x} \to \CC$ such that $L(\lambda p) = \lambda^n L(p)$.
Noting that these are linear functions, such $L$ form a 1-dimensional $\CC\dash$vector space.

:::{.example title="K3 Surfaces"}
The classic example is $x_0 \in \OO(1)_{\vector x}$ since $x_0( \lambda p) = \lambda x_0 (p)$.
Similarly, $x_0^2 + x_1 x_2 \in \OO(2)_{\vector x}$ since 
\[
x_0^2 + x_1 x_2 (\lambda p) = \lambda^2 (x_0^2 + x_1 x_2(p))
.\]

Note that the global sections were given by $\Gamma^0(\PP^n, \OO(d)) = H^0(\PP^n; \OO(d))$ was the span of degree $d$ monomials in $x_0, \cdots, x_n$.
For example $x_0^2 + x_1 x_2$ is a well-defined element of $\OO(2)_p$ which varies holomorphically with $p$, yielding a section:

:::{.example title="?"}
For a K3 surface, consider $S = \ts{ \sum_{i=0}^4 x_i^4 = 0 } \subset \CP^3$.
By the adjunction formula, 
\[
K_S = \ro{\qty{ K_{\CP^3} \tensor \OO_{\CP^3}(S) }}{S}
.\]
Note that if $s\in H^0(\mathcal{L})$, we can recover $\OO(\div S) = \mathcal{L}$. 
Moreover, $K_{\CP^3} = \OO(-4)$ and $\OO_{\CP^3}(S) = \OO(4)$ since we can view the formula as a function on the tautological line, which yields a section.
So we get $K_S = \OO(-4) \tensor \OO(4) = \OO(0) = \OO$, i.e. these yield actual functions on $\CP^n$ since they're products of functions that scale by $\lambda^{-4}$ and functions that scale by $\lambda^4$.
We're using the fact that $\OO_{\vector p = [x_0: \cdots : x_n]}$ are functions $L$ such that $L(\lambda p) = \lambda^0 L(p) = L(p)$, which yields a well-defined function on $\CP^n$.
So quartics in $\PP^3$ have trivial canonical bundle, i.e. $K_S = \OO_S$ for $S = V(x_0^4 + x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4)$.

We know that $H^0(S, K_S)$ are the globally holomorphic 2-forms on $S$, and here this is isomorphic to $H^0(S, \OO_S) = \CC \Omega_S$ for some single holomorphic 2-form.
Moreover $\div (\Omega_S) = 0$ since $\OO( \div ( \Omega_S)) = K_S = \OO_S$.
So these are the analogs of elliptic curves in dimension 2, since for example $E \da \CC/ \Lambda$ has a nonvanishing section $\dz \in H^0(E, K_E)$, and we can write $E = V(f)$ for $f$ a cubic in $\PP^3$, and we computed the genus of cubics.
Moreover, every genus 1 curve is $\CC$ mod a lattice.

Recall an exercise from the notes: computing the Hodge diamond of a genus 5 curve.
We'll compute the diamond for a K3 surface:

\begin{tikzcd}
	&& {h^{2, 2}} \\
	& {h^{3, 1}} && {h^{1, 3}} \\
	{h^{2, 0}} && {h^{1, 1}} && {h^{0, 2}} \\
	& {h^{1, 0}} && {h^{0, 1}} \\
	&& {h^{0, 0}}
\end{tikzcd}

We know $h^{2, 0} = H^0( S, \Omega_S^2)$, which yields 1s:

\begin{tikzcd}
	&& 1 \\
	& {h^{3, 1}} && {h^{1, 3}} \\
	1 && {h^{1, 1}} && 1 \\
	& {h^{1, 0}} && {h^{0, 1}} \\
	&& 1
\end{tikzcd}

We'll use the following theorem:


:::{.theorem title="Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem"}
Let $X \subset \PP^n$ with $\dim X > 3$.
Then $\pi_1(X) \cong \pi_1(X \intersect H)$ for $H$ a hypersurface intersection $X$ at a smooth codimension 1 complex manifold.
:::

:::{.remark}
Applying this to $X = \PP^3$, we have $V(x_0^4 + \cdots + x_3^4) = S$, we have $\pi_1(\PP^3) = \pi_1(S)$.
We can write $\PP^3 = \CC \union \CC^2 \union \CC^4$, which is a cell decomposition with cells only in degrees 0,2,4, and so in fact $\pi_1(\PP^n) = 0$.

:::{.corollary title="h1 of K3 surfaces"}
K3 surfaces are simply connected, and $h^1(S; \CC) = 0$.
:::

Note that anything embedded in projective space as a complex submanifold is KÃ¤hler by restricting the Fubini-Study form.
Using simple connectedness and Serre duality, we have

\begin{tikzcd}
	&& 1 \\
	& 0 && 0 \\
	1 && {h^{1, 1}} && 1 \\
	& 0 && 0 \\
	&& 1
\end{tikzcd}

We know $\chi(\OO_S) = (1/12)(K^2+\chi_\Top)$, and since $K_S = \OO_S$ is trivial, we have $c_1(\OO_S) = 0$.
Noting that $h^{p, q} = H^( \Omega^p)$, so we can sum the lower-right part of the diamond to get $\chi(\OO_S) = 1 - 0 + 1 = 2$, since we take $p=0$ to get \( \Omega^p = \OO \).
Computing $\chi_\Top$, we get $h_{1, 1} = 20$.

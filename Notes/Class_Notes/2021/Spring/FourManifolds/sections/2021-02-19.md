## Applications of Riemann-Roch


:::{.definition title="Curves"}
A **curve** is a compact complex manifold of complex dimension 1.
:::


:::{.example title="?"}
Let $C$ be a curve, then \( \Omega_C^1 \) is the sheaf of holomorphic 1-forms, and \( \Omega_C^{>1} = 0 \).
We also have the sheaves \( A^{1, 0}, A^{0, 1}, A^{1, 1}, \) the sheaves of smooth $(p, q)\dash$forms.
Here the only nonzero combinations are $(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)$ by dimensional considerations.
Let $L$ be a holomorphic line bundle on $C$, then 
\[ \chi(C, L) = h^0(L) - h^1(L) = \deg(L) + 1 - g .\]

:::{.remark}
In general it can be hard to compute $h^1(L)$, since this is sheaf cohomology (sections over double overlaps, cocycle conditions, etc).
On the other hand, $h^0$ is easy to understand, since $h^0( \Omega^1_C)$ is the dimension of the global holomorphic sections $H^0(C, L) = L(C)$.
A key tool here is the following:

### Serre Duality

:::{.proposition title="Serre Duality"}
\[
H^1(C, L) \cong H^0(C, L ^{-1} \tensor \Omega_C^1)\dual
,\]
noting that these are both global sections of a line bundle.
:::


:::{.proof title="of Serre Duality"}
Recall that we had a resolution of the sheaf $L$ given by by smooth vector bundles:
\[
0 \to L \injects L\tensor A^{0, 0} \mapsvia{\delbar} L \tensor A^{0, 1} \mapsvia{\delbar} 0
.\]
So we know that 
\[
H^1(C, L) = H^0(L\tensor A^{0, 1}) / \delbar H^0(L\tensor A^{0, 0})
.\]
Choose a Hermitian metric $h$ on $L$, i.e. a map $h: L\tensor \conjugate{L} \to \OO$.
On fibers, we have $h_p: L_p \tensor \bar{ L_p } \to \CC$.
We'll also choose a metric on $C$, say $g$.
Since $C$ is a Riemann surface, we have an associated volume form $\nu$ on $C$ (essentially the determinant), so we can define a pairing between sections of $L\tensor A^{0, 0}$:
\[
\inner{s}{t} \da \int_C h(s, \conjugate{t} ) \,d\nu
.\]
Note that 
\[
\inner{s}{s} = \int_C h(s, \conjugate{s}) \,d\nu \geq 0
&& \text{since }
h(s, \conjugate{s})(p) = 0 \iff s_p = 0
,\]
and moreover this integral is zero if and only if $s=0$.
So we have an inner product on $H^0(L\tensor A^{0, 0})$.
We can also define a pairing on sections of $L\tensor A^{0, 1}$, say
\[
\inner{ s \otimes \alpha}{ t \otimes \beta} = \int_C h(s, \conjugate{t}) \alpha\wedge \conjugate{\beta}
.\]
Note that $h$ is a smooth function and \( \alpha\wedge \conjugate{\beta} \) is a $(1, 1)\dash$form.
Moreover, this is positive and nondegenerate.
We want to understand the cokernel of the linear map
\[
H^0(L \otimes A^{0, 0}) \mapsvia{\delbar} H^0( L \otimes A^{0, 1})
.\]
To compute \( \coker(\delbar) \), we can look at the kernel of the adjoint, and it suffices to find the orthogonal complement of $\im( \delbar)$, i.e. 
\[
\coker(\delbar) = \ts{ t\in H^0(L\tensor A^{0, 1}) \st \inner{\delbar s}{t} = 0 \, \forall s} 
.\]

\begin{tikzpicture}

\end{tikzpicture}

So we want to understand sections $t\in H^0(L\tensor A^{0, 1})$ such that 
\[
\int_C (\delbar s)\conjugate{t} = 0 && \forall s\in H^0(L\tensor A^{0, 0})
,\]
where $\bd C = \emptyset$.
We'll basically want to do integration by parts on this.
Note that $h(s, t) = hst$ here where we view $h$ as a certain section.
Note that \( \conjugate{t} \in H^0(\conjugate{L} \tensor A^{1, 0}) \), so we can replace \( \del \) with $d = \delbar + \del$ and apply Stokes' theorem:
\[
\int_C s d(h \conjugate{t}) &= 0 && \forall s\in H^0(L\tensor A^{0, 0}) \\
0 
&= \int_C s\delbar (h \conjugate{t}) \\
&= \int_C s {\delbar (h \conjugate{t}) \over d\nu}d\nu\\
&= \inner{s}{\conjugate{\delbar (h \conjugate{t}) \over d\nu }}
\]
where \( h \in C^{\infty }(L ^{-1} \tensor \conjugate{L}\inv ) \) and \( h\conjugate{t} \in C^{\infty }(L\inv \tensor A^{1, 0}) \).
But the right-hand side is in $H^0(L \tensor A^{0, 0} )$ and by nondegeneracy we can conclude
\[
\conjugate{\delbar (h \conjugate{t}) \over d\nu } = 0
\iff \delbar(h\conjugate{t}) = 0
.\]
We thus have \( h\conjugate{t} \in H^0( L \inv \tensor A^{1, 0} \) which is a holomorphic line bundle tensored with $A^{0, 0}$.
Thus $\coker(\delbar) \cong_h H^0( L ^{-1} \tensor \Omega^1)$.

:::{.remark}
We showed \( \inner{\delbar s}{t} = \inner{s}{Y (t)} \) where $Y$ is the adjoint given above.
Then the kernel of $Y$ wound up being where $\delbar$ vanishes, i.e. holomorphic sections of a separate bundle.
Here we had

- $t \in H^0(L\tensor A^{0, 1})$
- $\conjugate{t} \in H^0(\conjugate L\tensor A^{1,0})$
- $h\in H^0( L ^{-1} \tensor \conjugate{ L ^{-1} })$

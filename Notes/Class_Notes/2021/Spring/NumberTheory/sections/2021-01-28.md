# Euclidean Quadratic Fields (Lec. 5, Thursday, January 28)

## Setup

:::{.remark}
Today: roughly corresponds to Chapter 5.
In a first algebra course, one shows that if $R$ is a Euclidean domain, then the arithmetic of $R$ is very interesting:

- $R$ is a PID, and as a consequence
- $R$ is a UFD

:::

:::{.definition title="Euclidean Domain"}
A domain $R$ is **Euclidean** if and only if there is a function $\varphi R\smz \to \ZZ^{\geq 0}$ such that for all $a,b\in R$ with $b\neq 0$ there are $q, r\in R$ with $a = bq + r$ with $r=0$ or \( \varphi(r) < \varphi(b) \).
\( \varphi \) is referred to as a **Euclidean function**.
:::

:::{.example title="Examples of Euclidean functions"}
\envlist

- For $R=\ZZ$, one can take \( \varphi(\wait) \da \abs{\wait} \).
- $R = \FF[t]$ for $\FF$ a field with \( \varphi(\wait) = \deg(\wait) \).
:::

:::{.remark}
Given a number field $K$, does $\ZZ_K$ have nice factorization, i.e. is it a UFD?
Not always, as we saw last time.
If it were Euclidean, then yes!
:::

:::{.question}
Which quadratic fields $K$ have a Euclidean ring of integers $\ZZ_K$?
:::

:::{.definition title="Euclidean and Norm-Euclidean Number Fields"}
If $K$ is a quadratic field, then 

- $K$ is **Euclidean** if and only if $\ZZ_K$ is a Euclidean domain,

- $K$ is **norm-Euclidean** if and only if $\ZZ_K$ is Euclidean with respect to \( \varphi(\wait) \da \abs{N(\wait)} \).

:::

:::{.proposition title="Characterization of norm-Euclidean quadratic fields"}
Let $K$ be a quadratic field.
Then $K$ is norm-Euclidean if and only if for all \( \beta\in K \) there is a \( \gamma\in \ZZ_K \) such that \( \abs{ N(\beta- \gamma) } < 1 \).
In other words, $K$ is norm-Euclidean if and only if  every element can be approximated by an element in $\ZZ_K$.
:::

:::{.proof title="of proposition"}
$\impliedby$:
Let \( a,b \in \ZZ_k \) with \( b\neq 0 \).
Define \( \beta\da a/b \in K \), then by assumption choose \( \gamma \) such that \( \abs{N \qty{ {a\over b} - \gamma} }< 1  \).
Multiplying both sides by \( N(b) \) and using the fact that $N(\wait), \abs{\wait}$ are multiplicative, we have 
\[
\abs{N(a - b \gamma)} < \abs{N(b)} 
.\]
Then $a = bq + r \da b \gamma + (a - b \gamma)$.
:::

## Norm-Euclidean Imaginary Quadratic Fields

:::{.remark}
Suppose $K = \QQ( \sqrt{d} )$ with $d<0$ squarefree, so we can write
\[
K = \ts{ a + b \sqrt{d} \st a,b, \in \QQ }
= \ts{ a + b i\sqrt{\abs{d}} \st a,b, \in \QQ } \subseteq \CC
.\]
Geometrically, this is a dense subset of $\CC$, so it's not easy to draw.
But we can draw $\ZZ_K$ -- what does it look like?
We know that $d=2,3 \mod 4$ then $\ZZ_K = \ts{a + b \sqrt{d} \st a,b,\in \ZZ}$:

\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw [thick, gray,-latex] (-5, 0) -- (7, 0);% Draw x axis
    \draw [thick, gray,-latex] (0, -5) -- (0, 5);% Draw y axis

    \clip (-5,-5) rectangle (10cm,10cm); % Clips the picture...
    %\pgftransformcm{1}{0.6}{0.7}{1}{\pgfpoint{0cm}{0cm}}
          % This is actually the transformation matrix entries that
          % gives the slanted unit vectors. 
    \draw[style=help lines,dashed] (-14,-14) grid[step=2cm] (6,5);
          % Draws a grid in the new coordinates.
          %\filldraw[fill=gray, fill opacity=0.3, draw=black] (0,0) rectangle (2,2);
              % Puts the shaded rectangle
    \foreach \x in {--3,-2,-1,0,1,2}{% Two indices running over each
      \foreach \y in {-2,-1, ..., 2}{% node on the grid we have drawn 
        \node[draw,circle,inner sep=2pt,fill] at (2*\x,2*\y) {};
            % Places a dot at those points
      }
    }
        \node[draw,red, circle,inner sep=2pt,fill] at (0, 0) {};

	\draw [decorate,decoration={brace,amplitude=10pt},xshift=-4pt,yshift=0pt] (6.5,2.0) -- (6.5,0.1) node [black,midway,xshift=25pt] {\footnotesize $\sqrt{\abs{d}}$};
	\draw [decorate,decoration={brace,amplitude=10pt},xshift=-4pt,yshift=0pt] (6.5,-0.1) -- (6.5,-2) node [black,midway,xshift=25pt] {\footnotesize $\sqrt{\abs{d}}$};

\end{tikzpicture}

When $d \equiv 1 \mod 4$, we have $\ZZ_k = \ts{ {1\over 2}(a + b \sqrt{d} ) \st a,b,\in \ZZ,\, a\equiv b \mod 2}$.
On the real axis, if $b=0$ then $a$ is an even integer and $\ts{(1/2)a}$ is all integers.
To get the remaining elements, we don't just shift up and down: setting $b=1$ yields elements that look like $(1/2)a + \sqrt{d}$ where $a$ is odd, so we get the following:

\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw [thick, gray,-latex] (-5, 0) -- (7, 0);% Draw x axis
    \draw [thick, gray,-latex] (0, -5) -- (0, 5);% Draw y axis

    \clip (-5,-5) rectangle (10cm,10cm); % Clips the picture...
    %\pgftransformcm{1}{0.6}{0.7}{1}{\pgfpoint{0cm}{0cm}}
          % This is actually the transformation matrix entries that
          % gives the slanted unit vectors. 
    \draw[style=help lines,dashed] (-14,-14) grid[step=2cm] (6,5);
          % Draws a grid in the new coordinates.
          %\filldraw[fill=gray, fill opacity=0.3, draw=black] (0,0) rectangle (2,2);
              % Puts the shaded rectangle
    \foreach \x in {--3,-2,-1,0,1,2}{% Two indices running over each
      \foreach \y in {-2,-1, ..., 2}{% node on the grid we have drawn 
        \node[draw,circle,inner sep=2pt,fill] at (2*\x,2*\y) {};
            % Places a dot at those points
      }
    }
\foreach \x in {--2,-3,-1,0,1,2,-2}{% Two indices running over each
      \foreach \y in {-2,-1, ..., 2}{% node on the grid we have drawn 
        \node[draw, circle,inner sep=2pt,fill] at (2*\x+1,2*\y+1) {};
            % Places a dot at those points
      }
    }
        \node[draw,red, circle,inner sep=2pt,fill] at (0, 0) {};

	\draw [decorate,decoration={brace,amplitude=10pt},xshift=-4pt,yshift=0pt] (6.5,1.0) -- (6.5,0.1) node [black,midway,xshift=25pt] {\footnotesize ${1\over 2} \sqrt{\abs{d}}$};
	\draw [decorate,decoration={brace,amplitude=10pt},xshift=-4pt,yshift=0pt] (6.5,-0.1) -- (6.5,-1) node [black,midway,xshift=25pt] {\footnotesize ${1\over 2} \sqrt{\abs{d}}$};
\draw [decorate,decoration={brace,amplitude=10pt},xshift=-4pt,yshift=0pt] (6.5,1.95) -- (6.5,1.05) node [black,midway,xshift=25pt] {\footnotesize ${1\over 2} \sqrt{\abs{d}}$};

\end{tikzpicture}

Now we can think of the criterion for an imaginary quadratic field to be norm-Euclidean: what does it mean to be within norm 1 of an element of $\ZZ_K$?
If $z\in K$, we can write $N(z) = z \bar z = \abs{z}^2$, and thus reformulate our criterion: $K$ is norm-Euclidean if and only if for all \( \beta\in K \) there exists a \( \gamma\in \ZZ_K \) such that \( \abs{\beta- \gamma}<1  \).
Note this this is the familiar geometric distance in $\CC$.

:::

:::{.example title="?"}
$\QQ(i)$ is norm-Euclidean: the ring of integers is $\ZZ(i)$, which is the integer lattice in $\CC$.
Note one can cover $\CC$ by open circles of radius 1:

\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw [thick, gray,-latex] (-5, 0) -- (7, 0);% Draw x axis
    \draw [thick, gray,-latex] (0, -5) -- (0, 5);% Draw y axis

    \clip (-5,-5) rectangle (10cm,10cm); % Clips the picture...
    %\pgftransformcm{1}{0.6}{0.7}{1}{\pgfpoint{0cm}{0cm}}
          % This is actually the transformation matrix entries that
          % gives the slanted unit vectors. 
    \draw[style=help lines,dashed] (-14,-14) grid[step=2cm] (6,5);
          % Draws a grid in the new coordinates.
          %\filldraw[fill=gray, fill opacity=0.3, draw=black] (0,0) rectangle (2,2);
              % Puts the shaded rectangle
    \foreach \x in {--3,-2,-1,0,1,2}{% Two indices running over each
      \foreach \y in {-2,-1, ..., 2}{% node on the grid we have drawn 
        \node[draw,circle,inner sep=2pt,fill] at (2*\x,2*\y) {};
            % Places a dot at those points
      }
    }
        \node[draw,red, circle,inner sep=2pt,fill] at (0, 0) {};

\filldraw[dotted, fill=blue!50, draw=blue, very thick, fill opacity=0.2] (2,0) circle (2cm);
\filldraw[dotted, fill=blue!50, draw=blue, very thick, fill opacity=0.2] (0,0) circle (2cm);
\filldraw[dotted, fill=blue!50, draw=blue, very thick, fill opacity=0.2] (-2,0) circle (2cm);
\node at (5, 1) {$\cdots$};
\end{tikzpicture}


Continuing this way, every point with rational coordinates can be covered by some open disc of radius 1:

\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw [thick, gray,-latex] (-5, 0) -- (7, 0);% Draw x axis
    \draw [thick, gray,-latex] (0, -5) -- (0, 5);% Draw y axis

    \clip (-5,-5) rectangle (10cm,10cm); % Clips the picture...
    %\pgftransformcm{1}{0.6}{0.7}{1}{\pgfpoint{0cm}{0cm}}
          % This is actually the transformation matrix entries that
          % gives the slanted unit vectors. 
    \draw[style=help lines,dashed] (-14,-14) grid[step=2cm] (6,5);
          % Draws a grid in the new coordinates.
          %\filldraw[fill=gray, fill opacity=0.3, draw=black] (0,0) rectangle (2,2);
              % Puts the shaded rectangle
    \foreach \x in {--3,-2,-1,0,1,2}{% Two indices running over each
      \foreach \y in {-2,-1, ..., 2}{% node on the grid we have drawn 
        \node[draw,circle,inner sep=2pt,fill] at (2*\x,2*\y) {};
\filldraw[dotted, fill=blue!50, draw=blue, very thick, fill opacity=0.2] (2*\x,2*\y) circle (2cm);

            % Places a dot at those points
      }
    }
        \node[draw,red, circle,inner sep=2pt,fill] at (0, 0) {};


\node at (5, 1) {$\cdots$};
\end{tikzpicture}

:::{.remark}
Note that this doesn't work for arbitrary $d$, since the distance between the horizontal lines grows with $d$.
It's not hard to work out the exact list where everything *is* covered:

:::

:::{.theorem title="When quadratic fields are norm-Euclidean"}
$K$ is norm-Euclidean if and only if $d\in \ts{-1,-2,-3,-7,-11}$.
:::

:::{.corollary title="When rings of integers are PIDs/UFDs"}
For these $d$, $\ZZ_K$ is a PID and thus a UFD.
:::

:::{.remark}
So we've classified all norm-Euclidean imaginary quadratic fields.
What about removing the word "norm"?
We restricted to $\abs{N(\wait)}$ because there was a particularly nice geometric interpretation, whereas being Euclidean involves a mysterious \( \varphi \).
Remarkably, it can be done, and it's the same list!


:::

:::{.theorem title="Motzkin"}
For $K$ an imaginary quadratic field, $K$ is Euclidean if and only if $d\in \ts{-1,-2,-3,-7,-11}$.
:::

:::{.remark}
If $\ZZ_K$ were never a PID in these cases, we could immediately conclude it wasn't Euclidean either. 
But there are values of $d$ not on this list for which $\ZZ_K$ is a PID, e.g. $d=-19$.
Since $-19 \equiv 1 \mod 4$, one can write $\ZZ_K = \ZZ\left[ {1 + \sqrt{-19} \over 2}\right]$, and by Motzkin's theorem this is a PID which is not a Euclidean domain.
:::

:::{.remark}
We'll prove this theorem!
First we need a few lemmas.
:::

:::{.lemma title="Most imaginary quadratic fields have only two units"}
Let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field, then $U(\ZZ_K) = \ts{\pm 1 }$ except if $d=-1, -3$.
:::

:::{.proof title="of lemma (Important!)"}
We know that the units $u$ satisfy $\abs{N(u)} = 1$, and for imaginary quadratic fields norms are non-negative, so we know $N(u) = 1$.
What are the solutions this equation?
Suppose $d=2,3 \mod 4$, then we can write \( \alpha = a + b \sqrt{d} \)  with \( a,b\in \ZZ \) and \( 1 = N \alpha = a^2 - db^2 = a^2 + \abs{d}b^2  \).
If \( \abs{d}= 1  \) then this will have four solutions: $(a, b) = (\pm 1, 0), (0, \pm 1)$.

\

Otherwise if \( \abs{d}> 1  \) then $b=0$ and $a^2=1 \implies a = \pm 1$ and thus  \( \alpha = \pm 1 \).
So in this case, the only units are $\pm 1$, unless \( \abs{d} = 1 \).
But the only negative squarefree integer of absolute value 1 is $-1$.

Suppose $d \equiv 1 \mod 4$.
In this case, we need 
\[
1 = {a^2 + \abs{d} b^2 \over 4} \implies a^2 + \abs{d}b^2 = 4  
.\]
Note that $d<0$ is $1\mod 4$, so it's possible that $d=-3$ -- but this was one of the exceptions in the theorem, so assume otherwise.
Thus \( \abs{d}\geq 7  \), which forces $b=0 \implies a^2 = 4 \implies a = \pm 2$.
Then \( \alpha= \pm 1 \).
:::

:::{.remark}
For the excluded cases, the units can be explicitly computed.
When $d=-1$, $U(\ZZ[i]) =\ts{\pm 1, \pm i}$, yielding 4 units.
When $d=-3$, 
\[
U\qty{\ZZ\left[ {1 + \sqrt{-3} \over 2 } \right]} = \ts{\pm 1, {\pm 1 \pm \sqrt{-3} \over 2}}
,\]
yielding 6 units.
Note that in the first case, these are exactly the 4th roots of unity, and in the second case these are the sixth roots.
This is a general phenomenon that will appear again!
:::

:::{.lemma title="Norm of generator of principal ideal equals size of quotient"}
Let $K$ be any quadratic field and \( \alpha\in \ZZ_K \).
Then \( \# \ZZ_k / \gens{ \alpha } = \abs{N( \alpha )}   \).
:::

## Proof of Motzkin's Theorem

:::{.proof title="of Motzkin's Theorem"}
We want to show that being Euclidean implies $d=-1,-2,-3,-7,-11$.
Suppose $\ZZ_K$ is Euclidean with respect to \( \varphi \).
Choose \( \beta\in \ZZ_K \) nonzero and not a unit with \( \varphi(\beta) \) minimal among all such \( \beta \).

:::{.claim}
\[
\# \ZZ_K / \gens{ \beta } \leq 3 
.\]
:::

:::{.proof title="of claim"}
For any \( \alpha\in \ZZ_K \) and consider it in the quotient.
Since $\ZZ_K$ is Euclidean, we can write \( \alpha = \beta + \gamma+ \rho \) where either \( \rho=0 \) or \( \varphi(\rho ) < \varphi (\beta ) \).
How can the second possibility occur?
\( \beta \)  was chosen to have a minimal \( \varphi \) value, so the only smaller elements are units.
So \( \rho = 0 \) or \( \rho \)  is a unit.
Reducing $\mod \beta$, we obtain \( \alpha= \rho \mod \beta \), and hence \( \# \ZZ_K / \gens{ \beta }  \leq 1 + \# U(\ZZ_K) \) where the 1 comes from the zero element and everything else in the quotient has a representative that is a unit.
This is bounded above by $3$ when $d\neq -1, -3$, which is one of the exclusions in the theorem.
:::

Now we have \( N( \beta) \leq 3 \) and this can be solved -- if $d$ is large, these solutions are widely distributed.
If $d = 2, 3 \mod 4$ then \( \beta= a + b \sqrt{d} \)  with \( a, b \in ZZ \) and \( a^2 + \abs{d}b^2 \leq 3  \).
We can assume \( \abs{d}> 3  \), since $d=-1, -2$ are excluded.
Then $b=0$ is forced, and $a = 0, \pm 1$.
But why can't \( \beta=0, \pm 1 \)?
It was chosen to be minimal among *nonzero nonunits*.
$\contradiction$

If $d \equiv 1 \mod 4$, then \( \beta= {a + b \sqrt{d} \over 2} \) where $a,b\in \ZZ,\, a\equiv b \mod 2$.
Then 
\[
{a^2 + \abs{d}b^2 \over 4} \leq 3 \implies a^2 + \abs{d}b^2 \leq 12  
.\]
Now considering that $-d\equiv 1 \mod 4 \implies -d \in \ts{ -3, -7, -11, \cdots}$, the first three of which are on our list of exclusions.
So we can assume \( \abs{d}\geq 15  \), which forces $b=0$, $a$ must be even, and $a^2 \leq 12$.
So $a=0, \pm 2 \implies \beta= 0, \pm 1$.
$\contradiction$

:::

:::{.remark}
What's the story for real quadratic fields?
We understand norm-Euclidean ones, although the proofs aren't nearly as simple.
Things worked out nicely here because we had circles in the plane; in the real case these end up being complicated hyperbolas.
One can prove that if $d > 73$ then $K \da \QQ(\sqrt d)$ is not norm-Euclidean.
What are the Euclidean real quadratic fields?
The situation is much different, and there are two open conjectures.
:::

:::{.conjecture}
For real quadratic fields $K$, $\ZZ_K$ is a PID for infinitely many $d> 0$.
We don't even know about to prove there are just infinitely many *number* fields satisfying this condition!
We believe this is true since it happens a positive proportion of the time experimentally.
:::

:::{.conjecture}
If $\ZZ_K$ is a PID, then $\ZZ_K$ is Euclidean with respect to some norm function.
This is a consequence of a certain generalization of the RH.
This is not true for imaginary quadratic fields.
Why is it different here?
The unit group plays a large role, and is infinite here.
The real conjecture is that for $K$ any number field, if $\ZZ_K$ is a PID with infinitely many units then $\ZZ_K$ is Euclidean.
:::

:::{.remark}
There has been some progress, a result along the lines of there being at most two exceptions, but we don't know if those exceptions exist.

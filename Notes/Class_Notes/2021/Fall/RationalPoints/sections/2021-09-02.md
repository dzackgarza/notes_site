## Correspondence of Forms

:::{.remark}
Last time: standard/reduced complexes, forms, and $H^1$.
A meta-definition for today: let $k, L \in \Field$ with $L\slice k$ finite and separable, and $X\slice k$ an object over $k$ (e.g. an algebraic variety, possibly with extra structure).
A **form** of $X\slice k$ split by $L$ is an object $X' \slice k$ of the same class as $X$ such that $X_L \mapsvia{\sim} X_L'$.
:::

:::{.theorem title="A meta-theorem"}
The theorem was that there is a canonical bijection
\[
\correspond{
  \text{Forms of } X \\ 
  \text{split by } L
}
&\mapstofrom
H^1_\Gal(L\slice k; \Aut_k(X_L))
\]
Note that we didn't assume the coefficients formed an abelian group, so we'll explain this today.
It  is true that $\Aut(X_L) \in \mods{\Gal(L\slice k)}$.
We'll say that $X'$ is just **a form** of $X$ if there exists some $L'$ finite separable that splits $k$.
In this case there is a correspondence
\[
\correspond{
  \text{Forms of }X
}
&\mapstofrom
  H^1_{\Gal}(L\slice k; \Aut_k(X_{k^s}) )
\]
:::

:::{.proof title="A meta-proof"}
What is the map?
Given a form $X'$, we by definition have $F: X_L' \mapsvia{\sim} X_L$, and we want a map $\Gal(L\slice k) \to \Aut_k(X_L)$ such that $\delta f = 0$ for the differential in cohomology.
Since $X'$ is defined over $k$, we have an action $\Gal(L\slice k)\actson X_L'$, i.e. a map $\Gal(L\slice k) \to \Aut(X_L')$, which we can compose with the given isomorphism to obtain
\[
f: \Gal(L\slice k) \to \Aut(X_L')\to \Aut(X_L)
.\]
We have $f( \sigma \tau) = f(\sigma) f(\tau)^\sigma$.
What happens if we change the isomorphism $F$ to some $F'$, changing by some $g\in \Aut(X_L)$

:::{.exercise title="?"}
Here $f$ changes by a map of the form $\sigma \to g(g\inv)^\sigma$.
:::

We'll write an inverse map using Galois descent.
Given $f: \Gal(L\slice k)\to \Aut_k(X_L)$ with $f(\sigma \tau) = f( \sigma) f( \tau)^{ \sigma}$, we want to construct a form of $X$.
Assume $X \in \Aff\Sch$, so $X = \spec(A)$ for some $A\in\kalg$, then define 
\[
X' \da \spec(A\tensor_k L)^{\Gal(L\slice k)}
\]
where the action is given by $f$.
:::

:::{.remark}
What is $\Aut_k(X\slice L)$ is nonabelian?
Then we just make this proof a definition, and set 
\[
H^1(L\slice k ; G) \da \ts{f: \Gal(L\slice k)\to G \st f( \sigma \tau) = f( \sigma) f( \tau)^{ \sigma} }/ ( \sigma\to g(g\inv ) ^{ \sigma})
.\]
Here the maps are of finite discrete groups.
This is a pointed set, using the constant map as a basepoint.
:::

## Torsors

:::{.definition title="Torsor"}
Recall that for $G \in \Alg\Grp\slice k$, a **torsor** for $G$ (or a *principal homogeneous space*) is

1. A form of $G$ under the left action of $G$ on itself, i.e. a variety $X$ with a left $G\dash$action $G\times X\to X$ where $X_L \mapsvia{ \sim} G_L$ using the left-translation action.
2. A $G\dash$variety $X$ such that $G\times X \mapsvia{\sigma, \pi_2} X\times X$ is an isomorphism.

:::

:::{.claim}
Note that these are equivalent if $G$ is smooth, which for us will always happen in characteristic zero.
:::

:::{.theorem title="?"}
If $G$ is smooth, then $G\dash$torsors are canonically in bijection with $H^1(k; G(k^s))$, and $G\dash$torsors split by $L$ biject with $H^1(L\slice k; G(L))$.
:::

:::{.exercise title="?"}
Prove this!
It suffices to show that $\Aut_{G_L}(G_L)\cong G_L$ as a $\Grp\Sch\slice{G_L}$.
:::

## Example: Kummer Theory

:::{.example title="Kummer theory"}
Suppose $\mu_p \subseteq k$, so $k$ contains all $p$th roots of unity.
Then a $\mu_p\dash$torsor is the same as a $\ZZ/p$ Galois extension of $k$, where we allow $k^p =\mu_p$ itself.
:::

:::{.theorem title="?"}
There is a bijection 
\[
\correspond{
  \ZZ/p \dash\text{extensions}
}
&\mapstofrom
H^1(k; \mu_p)
\]

:::

:::{.proof title="?"}
Use the SES
\[
1 \to \mu_p \to (k^s)\units \mapsvia{x\mapsto x^p} (k^s)\units \to 1
,\]
which yields a LES
\[
1 \to
H^0(k; \mu_p) \to
H^0(k; (k^s)\units) \mapsvia{x\mapsto x^p} 
H^0(k; (k^s)\units )\to
H^1(k; \mu_p) \to
H^1(k; (k^s)\units)
,\]
and identifying terms yields
\[
0 \to k\units / (k\units)^p \to H^1(k; \mu_p) \to H^1(k; (k^s)\units)
.\]

:::

:::{.example title="?"}
What is $H^1(k; (k^s)\units)$?
Use that $L\units = \Aut(V\slice L)$ where $V$ is a 1-dimensional vector space over $L$.
The claim is that by Galois descent, forms for a vector space split by $L$ are precisely vector spaces over $k$, which makes them all trivial.
This in fact implies the more general fact that $H^1(k; \GL_n(k^s)) = 1$.
:::

:::{.remark}
Kummer theory gives us an explicit form of the map
and identifying terms yields
\[
0 \to k\units / (k\units)^p \mapsvia{x\mapsto k[x^{1\over p} ]} H^1(k; \mu_p) \to H^1(k; (k^s)\units)
.\]
This can be found by unwinding the definition of the map from the snake lemma, or noting that the kernel of a map from the absolute Galois group cuts out exactly this field.
:::

## Geometry of Brauer Groups

:::{.example title="of $H^1$"}
$H^1(k; G)$ are forms of objects with automorphism groups $G$.

- Vector spaces are obtained by taking $G = \GL_n$.
- Forms of $\PP^n$, i.e. Severi-Brauer varieties, come from taking $G \da \PGL_{n+1}$.
- For $G$ finite, a form of $G$ is an Ã©tale $k\dash$algebra (product of separable extensions of $k$ with total Galois group $G$).
  - For $G$ simple, these are Galois extensions with Galois group $G$.
    For $G\da \ZZ/p$, this is Kummer theory.
- For $E$ an elliptic curve, all genus 1 curves are torsors for their Jacobian.
  So genus 1 curves $C$ with $\Jac(C) \cong E$ biject with $H^1(k; E(k^s))$.
:::


:::{.remark}
We'll now look at $H^2$, and there is a correspondence

\begin{tikzpicture}
\node {%
  \(
  H^2(G; A) \mapsvia{\sim} 
  \begin{aligned}
	\left\{

Given a set-theoretic section $s: G\to G'$, we get a map
\[
f_s: G\cartpower{2} &\to A \\
(g_1, g_2) &\mapsto s(g_1) s(g_2) s(g_1 g_2)\inv
.\]
Note that if $s$ is a group morphism, this is just the constant map.

:::{.claim}
One needs to show the following:

1. $\delta f_s = 0$, so one gets a cocycle.
2. Changing $s$ changes $f_s$ by a coboundary.
3. Make the inverse.
:::

The group operation here is $G' \cdot G'' \da G' \fiberprod{G} G'' / A$, and the multiplication map is 
\[
(a_1, g_1) \cdot (a_2, g_2) \da (a_1 a_2 f_s(g_1, g_2), \, g_1 g_2)
.\]

:::{.remark}
Suppose $1\to Z\to H' \to H\to 1$ is a SES of groups with a $G\dash$action such that $Z$ is in the center of $H'$.
Then there is a "LES"

Note that some terms here are only sets, so exactness means that differentials surject onto kernels, and $H^1(G; Z)\actson H^1(G;H')$ and $H^1(G; H)$ is the quotient by this action.

:::{.definition title="Brauer group"}
Take $1\to \GG_m \to \GL_n \to \PGL_n \to 1$, then we get a map 
\[
H^1(k; \PGL_n(k^s)) \mapsvia{\iota_n} H^2(k, (k^s)\units)
.\]
Then define the **Brauer group** of $k$ to be
\[
\Br(k) \da \Union_{n} \im(\iota_n)
.\]
:::


:::{.remark}
Studying $H^2$ is hard in general, so this fact is the reason we can actually study Brauer groups.

\todo[inline]{Something about Hilbert 90}

This surjection gives us geometric objects to work with.
We'll show this is a group next time, along with the following theorem:
:::

:::{.theorem title="?"}
\[
\Union_n \im(\iota_n) = H^2(k; (k^s)\units)
.\]

:::{.remark}
Let $R$ be a commutative unital ring in which $0\neq 1$ unless $R=0$.
The goal is to define a space $X$ such that $R$ is the ring of functions on $X$, imitating the correspondence between $X$ a manifold and $C^0(X; \RR)$.
Recall that an ideal $\mfp \in \Id(R)$ is **prime** iff $\mfp \subset A$ is a proper subset and $fg\in \mfp \implies f\in \mfp$ or $g\in \mfp$.

:::{.definition title="Spectrum of a ring"}
For $A$ a ring, $\spec(A)$ is the set of prime ideals.
Topologize this by setting the closed sets to be of the form $V(I) = \ts{ \mfp \in \spec(A) \st \mfp \contains I }$.
:::

:::{.remark}
Ideals are "contagious" under multiplication, so prime ideals have reverse contagion!
It remains to prove that $\spec(A)$ forms a topological space.
:::

:::{.example title="?"}
For $A$ a field, $\spec(A) = \ts{\gens{0}}$, since any other nonzero element would be a unit and put 1 in the ideal.
:::

:::{.example title="?"}
For $k$ an algebraically closed field, $\spec k[t] = \ts{ \gens{0}, \gens{t-a} \st a\in A}$.
This is a PID, so every ideal is of the form $I = \gens{f}$, so
\[
V(\gens{f})
= 
\begin{cases}
\spec k[t] & f=0 
\\
\gens{x-a_1, \cdots, a-a_k} & f = \prod_{i=1}^k (x-a_i)
\end{cases}
.\]

Note that this is not the cofinite topology, since $f=0$ is a generic point.
